## This checkout is a personal fork

This is neodejack's fork of backnotprop/plannotator. Read `FORK.md` before changing
serving, build, or install code. Never open PRs against upstream.

- Keep fork changes in new files (`packages/server/app-shell.ts`, `scripts/fork/`,
  `*.split.config.ts`). Upstream files carry only the few lines listed in `FORK.md`;
  every extra line there is a future merge conflict.
- Any `Bun.serve` that serves the UI must be `Bun.serve(withAppShell(htmlContent, {...}))`
  with the SPA catch-all `return serveAppShell(req, htmlContent)`. Without it the page
  goes back to 24 MB, uncached, per remote open.
- `/_app/` is reserved for hashed, immutable UI assets. Route nothing else there.
- Leave `apps/{hook,review}/vite.config.ts` as upstream has them. The split build
  derives from them.
- The CLI imports `apps/hook/dist/app-split.txt`. Always build with
  `bun run --cwd apps/review build && bun run build:hook`, which writes it; skipping
  it breaks the CLI at startup.
- This machine is the remote runner Amp calls. To ship a change, run
  `scripts/fork/build-binary.sh` and copy `dist/plannotator-fork` over
  `~/.local/bin/plannotator`. The upstream binary is backed up at
  `~/.local/bin/plannotator.upstream-0.27.19`.
- After merging upstream, run `bun test packages/server/app-shell.test.ts`, rebuild,
  and check that a remote-style request for `/` still returns the ~1 KB shell.

# Plannotator

A plan review UI for Claude Code that intercepts `ExitPlanMode` via hooks, letting users approve or request changes with annotated feedback. Also provides code review for git diffs and annotation of arbitrary markdown files.

> **Reusing the document UI (theme / markdown / editor / settings / comments / layout) in the commercial Workspaces app? Read `packages/ui/README.md` FIRST.** It explains the published `@plannotator/ui` + `@plannotator/core` packages and the host-override seams a host plugs its own backend into via `configurePlannotatorUI()`. A prior from-scratch reimplementation of this UI broke the app and was reverted — do **not** rebuild it or recreate `packages/document-ui`. Add a seam to `@plannotator/ui` instead, keep Plannotator's app unchanged, and never delete working code until a human confirms parity in the browser.

## Server Runtimes

There are two separate server implementations with the same API surface:

- **Bun server** (`packages/server/`) — used by both Claude Code (`apps/hook/`) and OpenCode (`apps/opencode-plugin/`). These plugins import directly from `@plannotator/server`.
- **Pi server** (`apps/pi-extension/server/`) — a standalone Node.js server for the Pi extension. It mirrors the Bun server's API but uses `node:http` primitives instead of Bun's `Request`/`Response` APIs.

When adding or modifying server endpoints, both implementations must be updated. Runtime-agnostic logic (store, validation, types) lives in `packages/shared/` and is imported by both.

## Installation

**Via plugin marketplace** (when repo is public):

```
/plugin marketplace add backnotprop/plannotator
```

**Local testing:**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./apps/hook
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` for remote mode, `0` / `false` for local mode, or leave unset for SSH auto-detection. Uses a fixed port in remote mode; browser-opening behavior depends on the environment. Remote ready messages also render a terminal QR code of the advertised URL when stderr is a TTY and the advertised host is overridden away from localhost (a QR of a localhost URL scans to nowhere), so another device can join without retyping the URL. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_AGENT_TERMINAL_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` to enable the annotate-mode agent terminal while `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` is active or the session is published with `--tailscale`. Off by default in both cases because the session is reachable by network peers and the PTY token is not an auth boundary. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` | Fixed port to use. Default: random locally, `19432` for remote sessions. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_URL_HOST` | Display-only hostname for advertised session URLs (issue #657), e.g. a Tailscale MagicDNS name or tailnet IP, so remote-mode links are reachable from another device instead of `http://localhost:<port>`. Host only — bare hostname, IPv4, or bracketed IPv6 (`[fd7a::1]`); the runtime-chosen port is always appended, and anything carrying a scheme, port, path, credentials, or whitespace warns once on stderr and falls back to `localhost`. Strictly display-only and remote-only: binding stays governed by `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE`; a local session ignores the override (localhost is advertised and opened, since only loopback is bound) with a once-per-process stderr warning to set `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=1`, and spawned agent-review jobs keep a pinned `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` API URL so a tailnet-only hostname cannot break local jobs. The sentinel `auto` resolves the host from Tailscale once per process, at first use in a remote session: `tailscale status --json` → `Self.DNSName` (trailing dot stripped), falling back to the single `tailscale ip -4` CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10) address; detection failure warns once on stderr and falls back to `localhost`, and detection never changes binding — `auto` is as display-only as any explicit host. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "urlHost": "host" }` or `{ "urlHost": "auto" }`); the env var takes precedence, and an empty-but-set env var (`PLANNOTATOR_URL_HOST=`) suppresses a config-file `urlHost`. Default: unset (`localhost`). |
| `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` | Custom browser to open plans in. macOS: app name or path. Linux/Windows: executable path. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_AI` | Set to `disabled` to disable Ask AI and the Review Agents / Guided Review execution surfaces, including provider and agent-job endpoints. Persisted guide data is retained and its server APIs remain available, but the in-app history browser is hidden while AI is disabled. External agents can still open reviews and submit annotations. The explicit annotate-mode agent terminal is separate and remains controlled by its own settings. Default: enabled. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE` | Set to `disabled` to turn off URL sharing entirely, including Guided Review share links (the review UI hides "Create share link", `POST /api/guide/:jobId/share` answers `403 { error: "sharing disabled" }`, and `plannotator guide share` refuses with exit 1). Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "share": "disabled" }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL` | Custom base URL for share links (self-hosted portal). Default: `https://share.plannotator.ai`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PASTE_URL` | Base URL of the paste service API for short URL sharing. Default: `https://plannotator-paste.plannotator.workers.dev`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_ORIGIN` | Explicit agent-origin override at the top of the detection chain. Valid values: `claude-code`, `amp`, `droid`, `opencode`, `codex`, `copilot-cli`, `gemini-cli`, `kiro-cli`, `pi`, `oh-my-pi`. Invalid values silently fall through to env-based detection. Unset by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_JINA` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable Jina Reader for URL annotation, or `1` / `true` to enable. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "jina": false }`) or per-invocation via `--no-jina`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_ANNOTATE_HISTORY` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable ALL annotate-session writes to the data dir: per-file version history (no copies of annotated files are written; the annotate version diff is unavailable) AND the durable submitted-feedback records (#678) that single-local-file annotate sessions otherwise write to `history/{project}/{slug}/submissions/` before deleting the draft on submit. Disabling it keeps annotate sessions fully stateless but also gives up that submit crash-recovery record. URL and annotate-last sessions never write either kind of data regardless of this flag. Folder sessions write no submitted-feedback records, but they do participate in per-file version history: the first time a session serves a file through /api/doc it snapshots that file (lazily, memoized per resolved path for the life of the server), which is what powers the per-file version diff when a folder file is reopened later; setting this flag to 0 disables those folder snapshots too. Setting it to 0 additionally suppresses **feedback archive** records for every annotate surface (single file, folder, URL, live app, annotate-last), so "fully stateless annotate session" stays literally true regardless of `PLANNOTATOR_FEEDBACK_HISTORY`. Raw-HTML and live-app pinpoints write their element context (selector, ancestor path, allowlisted attributes, visible text, a collapsed HTML skeleton, and the live route) into the submission records and drafts too; form values and inline handlers are never captured. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "annotateHistory": false }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_FEEDBACK_HISTORY` | Set to `0` / `false` to stop archiving submitted feedback under `~/.plannotator/feedback/` (or `PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR`). Default: enabled, which appends one record per submission at decision-settlement time on all three surfaces and in both runtimes: plan approve/deny, code review Send Feedback / Approve (LGTM) / Close, and every annotate submit / approve / close. A review posted straight to GitHub or GitLab with `POST /api/pr-action` is delivered to the platform and is not archived locally yet. **Note that this writes the user's own feedback text, the document and code excerpts it quotes, and per-annotation metadata to disk, and nothing prunes the directory** (same policy as `plans/`, `history/`, and `guides/`); delete `~/.plannotator/feedback/` or a project subdirectory to forget, or set this to 0 to never write. Code-review records carry diff IDENTITY only (vcsType, diffType, base, gitRef, snapshotId, cwd, PR metadata, changed-file count, patch byte count), never the patch bytes; plan records carry the decision text plus a reference to the `history/{project}/{slug}/NNN.md` version the decision was made on, never a second copy of the plan. Externally sourced annotations (linters, review agents, WebMCP browser agents) are included but keep their `source` / `author` tags, so `source == null` selects the reviewer's own comments; agent job outputs (guides, tours) are not archived. This knob governs only the new archive: the `planSave` decision snapshots in `plans/` and the #678 annotate submission records under `history/` are unaffected. Annotate surfaces honor `PLANNOTATOR_ANNOTATE_HISTORY` as well. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "feedbackHistory": false }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GUIDE_VIEWER_URL` | Base URL of the portable Guided Review viewer that exported guides pin (default `https://guides.show/v1/`). Must be `https:` (or `http:` on localhost for local viewer builds — `bun run --cwd apps/guides-show serve:local`); anything else is ignored. Read by the export endpoints of both servers and by `plannotator guide export` (which also accepts `--viewer-url`). |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GUIDE_SHARE_URL` | Base URL of the guide host that Guided Review share links are created on: the review UI's "Create share link", `plannotator guide share`, and `plannotator guide unshare` upload to and delete from it (default `https://guides.show`; the origin of your own deployment of its Cloudflare Worker otherwise, see the `apps/guides-show` README). Must be `http(s)`; credentials, query and fragment are dropped and a trailing slash is trimmed; an invalid value warns once on stderr and falls back to the default so a share setting can never break a server launch or CLI run. An empty-but-set env var counts as unset. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "guideShareUrl": "https://guides.example.com" }`); the env var takes precedence; there is no per-invocation flag. Resolved by `resolveGuideShareUrl` in `packages/shared/config.ts`. Whether sharing is allowed at all is `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE` (`disabled` turns guide share links off entirely). Removal always goes to the host a saved guide's record names, never merely the currently configured URL, so changing this after sharing does not strand a link. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GUIDE_HISTORY` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable persisting successful Guided Reviews (no guide copies are written to the data dir; the "Previous guides" list is then never populated, though already-saved guides remain readable and listed). **Note that a persisted guide includes a full copy of the diff it was generated against** — `history/.../guides/{id}.patch` beside the `{id}.json` envelope, uncapped, as large as the diff — because that patch is what a later portable export or share link renders (the diff is captured when the guide job launches, never re-read from the working tree). Deleting a guide removes both files; nothing prunes the directory otherwise. Turning this flag off skips the patch copy too, at the cost of exports and share links for guides from that session once the server exits. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "guideHistory": false }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_CURSOR_SANDBOX` | Set to `0` / `false` / `disabled` to stop passing `--sandbox enabled` when launching Cursor's `agent` CLI for review jobs — the flag pair is omitted entirely, deferring to the user's own Cursor Agent sandbox configuration. For systems where Cursor's sandbox cannot start (NixOS, AppArmor-restricted Linux). Default: enabled (`--sandbox enabled` is passed). Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "cursorSandbox": false }`); the env var takes precedence. Note: opting out means the review job's write protection relies on `--mode ask` plus the user's own Cursor configuration. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GIT_REMOTE_CHECK` | Set to `0` / `false` / `disabled` to stop code review contacting the git remote (issue #1553). Default: enabled, which runs `git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD` to discover the remote default branch and to compare the remote tip against the local tracking ref for the "Baseline is behind GitHub" banner. That probe is **not** on a timer: it runs at startup (the compare-target detection plus the staleness probe), on `/api/diff` page load, on `/api/diff/switch` (the diff-type/base pickers and the "Diff out of date · Refresh" button), and on the explicit `/api/fetch-base`, each rate limited to once per 60s per session, with the interval DOUBLING on failure up to a 15-minute cap and resetting to 60s on the next success (`nextRemoteBaseCheckInterval` in `packages/shared/review-core.ts`, shared by both runtimes). It is deliberately absent from `/api/diff/fresh`, which the client polls every 5s for as long as the page is open — hanging the probe there made an idle review query the remote once a minute forever, which on a smartcard-backed SSH setup is one hardware-key touch prompt per minute with nothing on screen to explain it. With the check off the session makes **zero** `ls-remote` calls, startup probes included: the compare target stays whatever LOCAL ref discovery resolved (`getDefaultBranch`: `origin/HEAD` → `origin/main` → `main` → …), `baseBehindRemote` never rides any payload so the banner never shows, and `POST /api/fetch-base` stays available because an explicit Fetch is the user asking for the network — note that with the banner gone so is its one-click Fetch button, which lives in that banner, so the endpoint matters to API callers rather than to the reviewer, and its post-fetch `refreshRemoteBaseInfo()` is a no-op under the opt-out. Only plain local git sessions are affected (PR, jj, GitButler, P4, workspace and static-patch sessions never ran the check). Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "gitRemoteCheck": false }`); precedence is `review --no-git-remote-check` flag > env var > config (`resolveGitRemoteCheck` in `packages/shared/config.ts`). The flag is parsed by the shared `parseReviewArgs`, so it works on every host that forwards review arguments — Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi — not just the Bun CLI. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_TODO_PROVIDER` | Set to `off` / `0` / `false` / `disabled` to stop mirroring the approved plan checklist into an editable todo provider during execution. Default: enabled, which syncs only when a provider is detected (currently pi-todos: detected when its todo directory exists — `<cwd>/.pi/todos` by default, or wherever `PI_TODO_PATH` redirects it when set). The repo-implied `<cwd>/.pi/todos` must realpath to a location inside the project or the provider reads as absent and never writes, so a symlink committed into a hostile repo cannot redirect todo writes out of it; an explicitly set `PI_TODO_PATH` is the user's own choice and is honored verbatim, including outside the project. The mirror is additive — the progress widget is unaffected either way — and sync is one-way, so provider-side edits never feed back into plan execution. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "todoProvider": "off" }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `JINA_API_KEY` | Optional Jina Reader API key for higher rate limits (500 RPM vs 20 RPM unauthenticated). Free keys include 10M tokens. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR` | Override the base data directory. Supports `~` expansion. Default: `~/.plannotator`. When unset, an existing `~/.plannotator` always wins; if it doesn't exist and `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set to an absolute path, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/plannotator` is used; otherwise `~/.plannotator` (the XDG spec's implicit `~/.local/share` default is deliberately not applied). All data (plans, history, drafts, config, hooks, sessions, debug logs, IPC registry) is stored under this directory. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_FILE_BROWSER_MAX_FILES` | File-discovery limit: regular files inspected by CLI markdown/folder resolution and startup code-file warming, supported files returned by the file browser, and directories scanned during multi-repo workspace discovery (symlinks may point outside the workspace, so the budget — not the root — bounds that walk). Must be a positive integer; invalid, zero, or negative values use the default of `5000`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GLIMPSE` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable the Glimpse native window even when `glimpseui` is installed. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "glimpse": false }`). |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GLIMPSE_WIDTH` | Width in pixels for the Glimpse native window. Default: `1280`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_GLIMPSE_HEIGHT` | Height in pixels for the Glimpse native window. Default: `900`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_VERIFY_ATTESTATION` | **Read by the install scripts only**, not by the runtime binary. Set to `1` / `true` to have `scripts/install.sh` / `install.ps1` / `install.cmd` run `gh attestation verify` on every install. Off by default. Can also be set persistently via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "verifyAttestation": true }`) or per-invocation via `--verify-attestation`. Requires the `gh` CLI, but not a login: the attestation bundle is fetched from GitHub's public attestations API (single unauthenticated attempt, never retried; the endpoint allows 60 requests/hour per IP) and verified with `--bundle`; the extraction needs one JSON tool on PATH (node, python3, or jq). gh's authenticated fetch is the fallback whenever the bundle path is unavailable or does not complete (missing extractor, fetch failure, or a gh that cannot verify the fetched bundle, e.g. an older gh without `--bundle`). Verification still needs network on every run because the Sigstore TUF trust root is fetched per-run; that failure is reported as connectivity, distinct from a real provenance failure, and both fail closed. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_CODEX_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Set to `1` / `true` to skip writing the Codex integration (`hooks.json` / `config.toml` under `CODEX_HOME`, and the Codex-home stale-skill cleanup) even when Codex is detected. The installer reports the honest state ("Codex: detected, skipped (...)" vs "not detected" vs installed) and never removes an integration a previous install wired. Also settable via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "skipInstall": { "codex": true } }`); precedence is `--skip-codex` flag > env var > config. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_GEMINI_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Same opt-out shape for the Gemini CLI integration (`~/.gemini` policy file, settings hook, slash commands). Config key: `skipInstall.gemini`; flag: `--skip-gemini`. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_KIRO_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Same opt-out shape for the Kiro CLI integration (`~/.kiro` skills and agent, including the `~/.kiro` stale-skill sweep). Config key: `skipInstall.kiro`; flag: `--skip-kiro`. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_OPENCODE_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Do-not-write switch for the OpenCode integration (command stubs under `~/.config/opencode/commands`, the OpenCode plugin cache clear, and the stale command-stub sweep). OpenCode has no detection leg, so there is no detected/not-detected reporting, just a skip note. Config key: `skipInstall.opencode`; flag: `--skip-opencode`. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_SKILLS_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Set to `1` / `true` to skip the skills/slash-command sparse checkout entirely — no `git clone` of the release tag, so nothing is written to any skill or command scope (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, the OpenCode command stubs, the Gemini `.toml` commands, `~/.kiro`), the extras are not offered, and the skill-scope cleanup sweeps stay suspended (skip means do-not-write, never remove). The binary, sem sidecar, agent-terminal runtime, hooks, and per-agent config still install, and git stops being a hard requirement. The installer reports `Skills: skipped (...)` and the closing banner stops claiming the `/plannotator-*` commands are ready. Unlike the per-agent opt-outs this is not one agent's home — it covers every scope the checkout writes. Config key: `skipInstall.skills`; flags: `--skip-skills` (bash/cmd), `-SkipSkills` (PowerShell); precedence is flag > env var > config. Used by the `install-script-smoke` CI job, which installs a synthetic `v9.9.9` whose tag has no GitHub counterpart. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_AGENT_TERMINAL_INSTALL` | Set to `1` / `true` to skip installing the managed Node/WebTUI runtime used by compiled Bun builds for the annotate-mode agent terminal. Read by `plannotator install-runtime agent-terminal`, which the installers call automatically. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_MINIMAL` | **Read by the install scripts only**, not by the runtime binary. Set to `1` / `true` / `yes` to have `scripts/install.sh` / `install.ps1` / `install.cmd` install **only** the `plannotator` binary, skipping the sem sidecar, the agent-terminal runtime, all per-agent skills, hooks, slash commands, and config, and the CallDiff runtime even when its opt-in is set. Equivalent to the `--minimal` (aliased to `--binary-only`) flag; `--no-minimal` overrides it. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SKIP_SEM_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Set to `1` / `true` to skip installing the optional `sem` semantic-diff sidecar (used by code review). Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_INSTALL_CALLDIFF` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Set to `1` / `true` / `yes` to ALSO install the optional pinned, pruned CallDiff core used by code review's Call Flow analysis (about 5 MB on macOS arm64, Node.js 22+). The runtime is strictly opt-in and is NOT installed by default. The normal path is in-app: enabling Call flow consents to one background install of core plus exactly the language packs required by the current changed files; later missing languages install automatically under the same consent, while the Languages list supports install-ahead. Each target gets one automatic attempt per review session; a failed target then requires an explicit Retry in that session. Equivalent to `--with-call-flow` (PowerShell: `-WithCallFlow`) or `{ "installCallFlow": true }` in `~/.plannotator/config.json`; precedence is flag > env var > config. `--minimal` always excludes it. Off by default. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_CALLDIFF_PATH` | Development override for a built CallDiff `0.4.1` package root containing `dist/run.js`; the exact pinned Tree-sitter core and any desired optional grammars must already exist under its `node_modules`. Managed language-pack installation is disabled for overrides. Normal installs use the selective managed core and grammar cache under the Plannotator data directory. |

**Config-only settings (`~/.plannotator/config.json`)**: Some settings have no env-var equivalent and are toggled by editing the config file directly:

- `markdownExtensions` (array of strings, default none) — extra file extensions the **annotate** path treats as markdown, e.g. `{ "markdownExtensions": [".livemd"] }` for Livebook notebooks (#1307). A listed extension is accepted everywhere `.md` is on that path: CLI target resolution (`plannotator annotate notes.livemd`), folder discovery and the file browser, `/api/doc` plus relative and wiki-link navigation between sibling docs, the 2MB `MAX_ANNOTATABLE_FILE_BYTES` cap, and per-file version history. Listed extensions render as **markdown** (frontmatter stripped), never as raw HTML, and they only widen the set: nothing built in is removed. Entries must start with a dot and be free of path separators, globs, and whitespace (`".livemd"`, not `"livemd"` or `"*.livemd"`); invalid entries are dropped silently, built-in extensions are deduplicated, and the dotenv family can never be registered: `.env` itself plus any entry ending in `.env` or starting with `.env.` (such as `.prod.env` or `.env.local`) is denied, because annotate copies file contents into the data dir (the same reason `.env` is excluded from the built-in set). The value is read from `config.json` once per process. Predicates stay pure in `packages/core/annotatable.ts`, which is browser-safe and cannot read config; the node-side resolver that threads the normalized list into them is `packages/shared/markdown-extensions.ts` (vendored to Pi), and the annotate `/api/plan` payload ships the same list to the renderer so it can linkify links to sibling documents. Not applied to plan write (`ALLOWED_PLAN_EXTENSIONS` in `apps/pi-extension/tool-scope.ts`) or to Edit Mode source save (`SOURCE_SAVE_FILE_REGEX` in `packages/core/source-save.ts`), which keep their own narrower allowlists.
- `agentTerminalSide` (`"left"` / `"right"` / `"hidden"`, default `"left"`): which edge the **annotate-mode** Agent TUI docks against, or `"hidden"` to keep it out of the layout entirely (#1050). Type and guard live in `packages/core/agent-terminal.ts:63-83`, the config declaration in `packages/shared/config.ts:116`. Unrecognized values are silently ignored rather than warned about: `getServerConfig()` omits the key behind `isAgentTerminalSide` (`packages/shared/config.ts:374`) and `resolveAnnotateAgentTerminalSide` independently falls back to `"left"` (`packages/core/agent-terminal.ts:90-94`). `"hidden"` is a default, not a lock: the terminal can still be opened for the session from the sidebar rail, the Shift-Shift shortcut, or a message routed to the agent, none of which rewrite the preference, and an opened `"hidden"` terminal docks left (`packages/core/agent-terminal.ts:101-105`). Settings is the only way back from `"hidden"`. Two UI surfaces write the key (the terminal's own Display popover Position control and Settings → General → "Agent TUI Position"), and the Display popover's reset button restores `"left"`. The side only decides where the terminal docks when opened; it never auto-opens (`packages/editor/App.tsx:523`), it is not rendered below 1024px or in wide mode (`packages/editor/agentTerminalLayout.ts:14`, `:73`), and `"right"` visually displaces the annotations/AI right panel while preserving its state (`packages/editor/agentTerminalLayout.ts:53-57`).
- `agentTerminalDefaultAgent` (string agent id, e.g. `"claude"` or `"codex"`, default `""` meaning no recorded choice): which agent the annotate-mode Agent TUI preselects when the panel opens (#1050). Validation is `typeof === "string"` only, with no enum and no check against installed agents, so an unknown or currently unavailable id is inert rather than an error: `resolveAnnotateAgentId` uses the saved id only when it appears among the available agents and otherwise takes the first available one (`packages/ui/utils/annotateAgentTerminal.ts:45-54`). It is written only by the "save as default" checkbox in the terminal's agent picker (`packages/editor/components/AnnotateAgentTerminalPanel.tsx:257`); there is no Settings control for it. An empty string deletes the cookie and reads as unset, though the server allowlist will still write `""` into `config.json`, where it is then ignored.
- Precedence for both agent-terminal keys follows the settings registry (`packages/ui/config/settings.ts`) and its resolver (`packages/ui/config/configStore.ts:3-5`): **server config file > cookie > built-in default**. `config.json` is the durable, cross-browser store; the cookie (`plannotator-annotate-agent-terminal-side`, `plannotator-annotate-agent-terminal-default`) is the browser-local fallback. There is no one-time cookie-to-config migration: those two cookie names were deliberately kept unchanged so a pre-registry cookie stays readable, and its value only reaches `config.json` if the user changes the setting again. The sync runs one direction at startup, with `init()` stamping a valid config value back into the cookie (`packages/ui/config/configStore.ts:157-161`). Neither key has an env-var equivalent, and only the annotate servers allowlist them on `POST /api/config` (`packages/server/annotate.ts:726-727`, mirrored in `apps/pi-extension/server/serverAnnotate.ts:690-691`), so setting them has no effect on plan or review sessions.
- `pfmReminder` (`true` / `false`, default `false`) — when enabled, a Plannotator Flavored Markdown reminder is injected at plan-time describing the renderer's extensions (code-file links, callouts, tables, diagrams, task lists, hex swatches, wiki-links). Lets the planning agent enrich plans with PFM features without having to discover them. Composes cleanly with the compound-skill improvement hook. Supported across all three runtimes: Claude Code (`improve-context` PreToolUse hook in `apps/hook/server/index.ts`), OpenCode (`experimental.chat.system.transform` in `apps/opencode-plugin/index.ts`), and Pi (`before_agent_start` in `apps/pi-extension/index.ts`).

**Legacy:** `SSH_TTY` and `SSH_CONNECTION` are still detected when `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` is unset. Set `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=1` / `true` to force remote mode or `0` / `false` to force local mode.

**Devcontainer/SSH usage:**
```bash
export PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=1
export PLANNOTATOR_PORT=9999
```

**Tailnet sessions (`--tailscale`):** `plannotator review --tailscale` (also `annotate` and `annotate-last`/`last`; other subcommands reject the flag with a clear error; Bun CLI only, not mirrored to Pi) publishes the session over the user's tailnet instead of remote mode: the server stays **loopback-bound** and the CLI orchestrates `tailscale serve --bg --https=<port> http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, so devices on the tailnet reach the session over HTTPS while nothing listens beyond localhost and nothing is ever public (serve, never funnel). The advertised HTTPS URL prints on stderr with a terminal QR code (TTY only), and a publishing failure exits `1` — or `2` under a strict annotate gate (`--require-approval` / `--result-file`), where `1` is reserved for "the reviewer did not approve" and a publish failure is a startup failure like any other — with an actionable message instead of leaving the loopback server hanging (CLI missing, daemon down or logged out, unparsable `serve status` output — which fails closed, or no serve URL matching the session port). A pre-existing serve mapping on the chosen port — background or foreground session, which Tailscale prefers — aborts rather than being stolen, and mappings on other ports are never touched. Mappings the process creates are cleaned up on normal exit and on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP (all routed through `process.exit` so exit handlers run; the SIGHUP route is installed by `enableTailscaleServe` only once a mapping exists — an unconditional SIGHUP listener would override the ignored disposition `nohup` depends on, so plain non-tailscale sessions keep no SIGHUP listener and `nohup plannotator review &` survives terminal close); a failed teardown retries once and then warns with the exact manual command, and a hard kill (SIGKILL) or reboot can leave the mapping — `tailscale serve --bg` state persists — so remove it with `tailscale serve --https=<port> off`. Combined with `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE`/SSH detection, `--tailscale` wins and forces local mode with a stderr notice — the wide `0.0.0.0` bind would only broaden exposure (`urlHost` is also suppressed for the run; the advertised URL comes from serve). The annotate agent terminal is **off by default** in `--tailscale` sessions, exactly like remote mode, because the session is reachable across the tailnet and the PTY token is not an auth boundary; enable it with `PLANNOTATOR_AGENT_TERMINAL_REMOTE=1`. Orchestration lives in `packages/server/tailscale-serve.ts` on shared parsers in `packages/shared/tailscale.ts`.

### Codex Stop hook: which turn the plan belongs to

Codex has no `ExitPlanMode`, so plan review rides its experimental `Stop` hook:
the hook reads the session rollout and returns the plan **the turn that just
stopped** produced. Anchoring on a turn is what keeps an older, already-decided
`<proposed_plan>` from being reopened (#1169), and the turn is resolved in
`resolveCodexStopPlan` (`apps/hook/server/codex-session.ts`) in two tiers:

1. **The payload's own `turn_id`** when the Stop JSON carries the field.
2. **The rollout's own turn markers** when it does not: the id of the LAST
   id-carrying `turn_context` / `task_started` marker in the newest rollout
   segment. A turn still in flight owns the last markers by construction, and
   when Stop fires at turn end the last marker is that turn's own, so one rule
   covers both shapes. The scan then still anchors on that turn's **first**
   marker, so a mid-turn compaction (which re-emits `turn_context` with the same
   id) cannot hide a plan the turn produced before it.

Tier 2 exists because `StopCommandInput.turn_id` only landed in Codex
**rust-v0.117.0** (`rust-v0.116.0-alpha.12`), while the hooks engine itself
shipped in **rust-v0.114.0**: stable `rust-v0.114.0`, `v0.115.0` and `v0.116.0`
fire the Stop hook with no `turn_id` at all. Their rollouts do record the id on
every turn marker (`TurnContext::to_turn_context_item` writes
`turn_id: Some(sub_id)`), which is what the fallback reads. Using it writes one
unconditional line to **stderr** (`logCodexStopTurnIdFallback`; stdout is the
hook's JSON decision channel, and Codex only reads a Stop hook's stderr on
exit code 2, which this hook never uses).

Fail-closed cases are unchanged: a payload that carries `turn_id` as a blank
string — or as anything that is not a string — is truncated or foreign, not an
old Codex, and is refused **before the rollout is read**; a rollout with no
id-carrying turn marker at all skips too. Both skips stay silent unless
`PLANNOTATOR_DEBUG` is set.

The deny→resubmit guard follows the same two shapes. When `stop_hook_active` is
set, the plan is served only if it changed across the boundary the previous
blocking Stop left in the turn. Codex >= 0.117 records that boundary as a
`<hook_prompt>` **user** message (`build_hook_prompt_message`); `rust-v0.114.0`,
`v0.115.0` and `v0.116.0` record it as a **developer** message
(`DeveloperInstructions::new(continuation_prompt)`), so the rollout-fallback
path — and only that path, which keeps every `turn_id`-carrying Codex
byte-identical — also accepts the last developer message in the turn as the
boundary. Without it the guard is inert on exactly the versions the fallback
enables, and an unrevised denied plan is re-served on every Stop of the turn.

## Code Review Flow

```
User runs /plannotator-review command
        ↓
Claude Code: plannotator review subcommand runs
OpenCode: event handler intercepts command
        ↓
VCS provider captures local changes (Git, GitButler, JJ, or P4 where supported). When review runs from a
non-VCS parent that contains nested Git/JJ/GitButler repos, child diffs are combined with
folder-prefixed paths.
        ↓
Review server starts, opens browser with diff viewer
        ↓
User annotates code, provides feedback
        ↓
Send Feedback → feedback sent to agent session
Approve → approved prompt sent to agent session (with the note/annotations when approving with notes)
```

### Review header decision control (agent mode)

The agent-destination review header uses the same adaptive split control the annotate surfaces
adopted: a ghost-X Close plus `DecisionControl` (`packages/ui/components/DecisionControl.tsx`)
rendered from the pure `buildDecisionSpec` mapping — `Approve` with no annotations,
`Send Feedback` otherwise, with `Request changes…` / `Send with a note…` and the explicit
`Approve, discard n annotations…` confirm behind the caret. One `submitPrimaryDecision()`
callback serves the header primary, the global `Mod+Enter` handler, and the compact primary row.
Transport routing is pure in `packages/review-editor/reviewDecision.ts` and single-endpoint:
every decision POSTs `/api/feedback` with `approved` as the only fork; a change-request note
becomes a `scope:'general'` `CodeAnnotation` (sentinel `filePath ''`/0/0, riding the export's
`## General` section) with a one-render deferred submit — zero server change. Approve-carrying
menu items (`Approve with notes`, `Approve with a note…`) are capability-gated on the
server-sent `approvalNotesSupported` advert, which rides every diff payload (`/api/diff`,
`/api/diff/switch`, `/api/pr-diff-scope`, `/api/pr-switch`, both runtimes) and reads as false
when absent, so an old server renders no approve-carrying items. For the OpenCode CLI bridge
the advert additionally requires the plugin's own `supportsApprovalNotes: true` declaration on
the `opencode-review` stdin JSON (the binary and plugin version independently; an old plugin
omits it and the advert fails closed, so a new binary can never hand an old bridge a note it
would discard). A capable session's approvals post `buildReviewApprovalBody`: bare approve
sends `feedback: ''` (the old `'LGTM - no changes requested.'` placeholder is gone — a bare
approval now archives as `lgtm` with no sidecar), "Approve with a note…" sends the note as the
feedback, and "Approve with notes" sends the live annotations plus their export (a note, if
both are ever present, is folded in ahead of the export — never dropped). The four agent-facing
decision consumers (Claude Code CLI, OpenCode native + CLI bridge, Pi) emit approvals through
the shared `composeReviewApprovedMessage` (`packages/shared/prompts.ts`, vendored to Pi):
a bare approval is the plain approved prompt; an approval carrying feedback uses the
approved-with-notes framing (`prompts.review.approvedWithNotes`, default
`DEFAULT_REVIEW_APPROVED_WITH_NOTES_PROMPT` — "non-blocking guidance, do not revise or
reopen"), because the bare prompt plus a change-request-shaped export would read as a
contradiction. The legacy placeholder is filtered there so a stale built client cannot get
filler framed as guidance. The standalone dev server (`apps/review/server`) is the exception:
it emits the raw decision JSON with the feedback unfiltered and does not route through the
composer. Compact/touch rows are generated from the same spec, so a visible positive decision
exists in every state; composer rows open `DecisionNoteDialog`. Platform (PR) mode renders the
same ghost-X + `DecisionControl` shape from `buildDecisionSpec`'s platform arm, with **no
composer items ever**: every menu action opens the existing `ReviewSubmissionDialog` (per-target
state, retry, "leave PR open" toggle — whose general-comment textarea is the only note field on
that side), and the self-approval mute is preserved — muted primary/items with the "You can't
approve your own {PR/MR}" reason, `Request changes…` / `Post comments, then…` always live.

Interaction-model changes worth knowing (F8 and siblings): the agent-mode `Approve` primary
follows the `FeedbackButton` responsive pattern and is **icon-only below the `lg` breakpoint**,
where the old `ApproveButton` showed a compact `OK` label — the `title` carries the accessible
name, and compact/touch rows keep full labels. Approving despite annotations is now two clicks
(caret → `Approve, discard n annotations…` → `Discard & approve`) instead of the old dimmed
one-click Approve with its warning dialog, and `Mod+Enter` never stacks with the removed
approve-warning dialog — an open confirm dialog owns `Mod+Enter` outright (the
`data-plannotator-confirm-dialog` sentinel guard in the app's keydown effect; without it one
keystroke over the discard confirm would post two contradictory decisions). Accepted edge: the
compact `DecisionNoteDialog` keeps its draft locally and discards it if the item behind it leaves
the live spec (the dialog closes), while the desktop popover composer keeps drafts keyed by item
id — an intentional asymmetry, not a bug.

The review sidebar carries the durable human producer for review-level comments:
**"+ General comment"** renders in the Annotations tab's General section header (even with zero
general comments) AND in the all-empty state, opening the shared `DecisionNoteField` in a small
anchored popover whose width clamps to the resizable panel (200-600px persisted) so it never
clips inside the sidebar's `overflow-x: hidden` scroll area. Composer state (open + draft) lives
in `ReviewSidebar`, shared by both placements: the draft survives a dismissal, a placement flip
(an external annotation arriving mid-sentence moves the button from the empty state to the
section header), and a tab switch; collapsing the sidebar discards it. The producer is
deliberately present in platform (PR) mode too — a session-level comment there rides the posted
review body through the pre-existing `scope:'general'` handling in `buildFileScopedBody` /
`ReviewSubmissionDialog`. Unlike the header composer's submit note (one-submit lifetime), a sidebar
general comment goes through `addCodeAnnotationsWithHistory` — undoable, draft-persisted,
deletable — and both producers share one shape factory, `createGeneralReviewComment` in
`reviewDecision.ts`: `scope:'general'`, sentinel `filePath ''`/0/0, `review-note-` UUID id, and
deliberately **no PR context**, so the comment passes every PR scope predicate and survives an
in-place PR switch. Creating one raises `totalAnnotationCount`, which is what flips the header
control to `Send Feedback` — the control is state-driven, not wired to the button. The
feedback archive records each annotation's `scope` (additive `scope?: string` in
`packages/shared/feedback-archive.ts`'s normalizer, vendored to Pi), so a review-level general
comment stays distinguishable from a line comment in `index.jsonl`.

### Since-main default review view

The default code-review diff is **`since-base`** — a composite of `merge-base(base, HEAD)` vs the working tree plus untracked files ("everything a PR would show if you committed and pushed now"). It can render as a three-section **git status** panel (Committed / Changes / Untracked) via `SectionsPanel`, with a `Tree | Git status | Commits` toggle (`PanelViewToggle`). The Commits segment (git-local sessions only) is a linear `--first-parent` history rail (`CommitsPanel`): clicking a commit opens its own diff (`commit:<sha>`, vs its first parent) as the all-files view headed by the commit message rendered as markdown. The Commits view is a self-contained detour: entering it memoizes the previously active diff, exiting to Tree restores that diff verbatim (exiting to Git status resets to `since-base` as always), the memo clears whenever any non-commit diff is applied, and a reload that serves a commit-family diff with a non-Commits panel view snaps once to the session default so the commit diff cannot outlive the visit. The toggle never writes the persisted `reviewPanelView`/`defaultDiffType` pair (no server writes from a toggle click), but it does record a cookie-only last-used memo (`reviewPanelViewLastUsed`, `sections` | `tree` — never `commits`; the Commits view is session-only). A review OPENS on caller-pinned flags (`plannotator review --base <ref>` / `--diff-type <id>`, session-only: `openStatePinned` on `/api/diff` disables the panel-pair self-heal and never persists anything) ?? session choice ?? last-used memo ?? persisted `reviewPanelView` ?? the registry default, which is **`tree`** (cookie-only, written only by Settings through `setReviewPanelView()`, which also syncs the memo so an explicit choice is never shadowed by a stale one — except the App self-heal, which passes `recordLastUsed: false` to repair the diff half of a conflicted pair without touching the memo). There is no first-run chooser: a profile with no `reviewPanelView` cookie opens on Tree, which renders every diff type, and the `Tree | Git status | Commits` toggle plus Settings → Git are the two ways to change it. The persisted pair is coupled: the Sections view only renders `since-base`, so choosing a classic diff default snaps the persisted view to Tree and vice-versa (enforced in the Settings Git tab and by the coupled setters in `packages/ui/config/reviewView.ts`); with `tree` as the default the pair is trivially consistent for a reviewer who has chosen neither, so the App self-heal only ever fires for a profile whose `reviewPanelView` cookie already reads `sections` — chosen in Settings, or seeded by a build whose registry default was still `sections`.

**Staging display invariant:** `useGitAdd`'s `stagedFiles` is the EFFECTIVE staged set (sections-sidecar snapshot + session stage/unstage overrides) and is the only source any surface may render staging state from. The sidecar entry's `staged` flag is a snapshot — ORing it back in makes files unstaged mid-session render as staged (and inverts the next toggle).

`since-base` is only offered when the base ref actually resolves — on a repo whose trunk isn't discoverable (`trunk`, no `origin/HEAD`) `getGitContext` omits it and the default falls through to `uncommitted`, so committed branch work is never silently hidden. The since-base patch/sections/fingerprint/file-content paths all degrade to `HEAD` together when merge-base fails for a resolvable-but-unrelated base. There is no first-run review-setup dialog (`ReviewSetupDialog` was removed, as `DiffTypeSetupDialog` was before it): the panel view simply defaults to Tree and the panel toggle / Settings → Git change it. The one-time dialog chain is guide intro → look-and-feel → Edit Mode → token hover cards → the terminal-tools announcement; none of the dialogs stack. The token hover announcement is last and additionally skips a session where hover cards cannot run at all (no live workspace), WITHOUT consuming its cookie, and never shows to a reviewer whose trigger is already non-default (which after the boolean-to-trigger migration is exactly the early adopter who turned cards off). Analysis layers no longer add a startup dialog: Semantic Changes retains its enabled default, while Call Flow remains disabled until the user explicitly enables it in Settings, which is also consent for its managed runtime installation.

### First-run terminal-tools announcement

A one-time panel announcing Plannotator's two terminal clients, **Plannotator
TUI** (`plannotator/plannotator-tui`) and **Herdr Annotate**
(`plannotator/herdr-annotate`). One cookie covers every surface —
`plannotator-announce-tui-herdr-seen`, value `'1'`, read and written by
`needsTerminalToolsAnnouncement()` / `markTerminalToolsAnnouncementSeen()` in
`packages/ui/utils/terminalToolsAnnouncement.ts` — so dismissing it in plan
review retires it in annotate and code review too, and vice versa. It is a
plain storage key rather than a settings-registry entry for the same reason
`lookAndFeelAnnouncement.ts` is: `configStore.ensureLoaded` seeds every
registry default into a cookie on first access, so a registry-backed flag could
never tell "never seen" from "seeded default".

The component is `packages/ui/components/TerminalToolsAnnouncementDialog.tsx`
(shared shell: portal, `z-[100]`, hand-rolled Escape + Tab wrap + focus
restore, `data-terminal-tools-announcement-dialog`). It is video first: the
real demo footage fills the top of the panel edge to edge, and the text under
it is one headline and one sentence, then one action row (star the two repos,
"Watch on X", "Got it"). There is no mock terminal, no install commands, no
feature list; the repo pages carry all of that. Two deliberate departures from
its siblings: the backdrop dismisses (the panel collects no decision, so there
is nothing to lose by closing it impatiently), and its keydown listener is
registered on the CAPTURE phase and swallows `Mod+Enter`, so a keystroke aimed
at the announcement cannot approve a plan or post a review behind it.

**Media is hosted, not bundled.** The two demos (`tui-herdr-full-demo` and
`tui-herdr-lite-demo`, mp4 + webm + poster jpg each, ~23MB together) live in
`apps/marketing/public/assets/` and are served from
`https://plannotator.ai/assets/` once the marketing deploy syncs them, the same
precedent as `GuideIntroDialog`'s hero image (the Edit Mode recording is small
enough to inline; these are not). The `<video>` is `muted playsInline loop`
with `preload="auto"`, mp4 first in source order, and `autoPlay` unless
`prefers-reduced-motion` matches, in which case the poster waits behind a
play button. A `Full | Lite` segmented switch (`role="tablist"`) swaps the
footage and the "Watch on X" link together; the panel is keyed per demo so
playback and load-failure state reset with it. If neither source can load
(offline), the frame keeps its place and shows a "Watch on X" link over it.
The panel's width follows the viewport HEIGHT as well as its width
(`min(1120px, 100%, (100dvh - 14rem) * 1280/806)`) so the video never
scrolls out of view on a short window. No CSP is involved: the app HTML ships
no `Content-Security-Policy`, and the servers only set one on sandboxed
artifact responses.

**Ordering: LAST in each app's chain, never first.** Code review gates it
through `terminalToolsAnnouncementCanShow` on guide intro, look-and-feel, Edit
Mode and token hover cards; the plan editor gates it on the
look-and-feel chooser, goal setup and permission-mode setup. The destination
spotlight and the auto-viewed toast were extended to defer behind it too, so
nothing stacks. Last rather than first because none of those dialogs consumes
this cookie: a session busy asking setup questions defers the announcement to
the next load instead of burning it, and that also puts it in front of the right
reader — someone opening Plannotator for the first time is still learning this
app, while the people who should hear that it now runs in a terminal are the
ones who already answered every setup question and see it on their next load.

Suppressed, never consumed, on: archive browsing and read-only shared plans
(which is also what the share portal serves, via `isSharedSession`), the
compact touch shell, and while the initial payload is still loading. The
guides.show portable viewer never mounts either App, so it is unaffected by
construction. `@plannotator/ui` exposes no first-run-suppression seam on
`configurePlannotatorUI`; a host that wants the announcement off installs its
own `storageBackend` (the documented escape hatch) and pre-seeds the key.

### Review drafts and PR pushes (#1590)

Code-review drafts (`/api/draft`) are keyed by `contentHash(rawPatch)`, so a local review whose diff changes still starts without its old draft (unchanged, out of scope). **PR mode only** additionally stores the draft under a stable target key, `prDraftTargetKey(meta, scope)` = `pr-` + hash of platform + host + repo (`owner/repo` or GitLab `projectPath`, lower-cased) + PR number + diff scope (`layer` / `full-stack` are different patches). All of it lives in `packages/shared/review-draft.ts` (vendored to Pi); both review servers hold one `createReviewDraftSession()` and route `/api/draft`, `/api/feedback` and `/api/exit` through it (without a target key every call is the plain `draft.ts` call, including the historical always-`ok` save response).

- **Load** tries the patch key first and returns it unless the target copy is strictly newer by `draftGeneration`. The target copy is stamped server-side with the `patchKey` it was saved on plus `patchKeys` (every patch it was ever saved on); when served for a different patch the response carries `patchChanged: true`. Clients can forge none of these fields and never see the lists.
- **Delete** clears the patch key, the target key, and every remembered patch key, with or without a generation. A decision (`/api/feedback`, `/api/exit`) additionally clears every PR target the session saved to or restored from (an in-place `/api/pr-switch` or `/api/pr-diff-scope` moves the target, and a submit must not leave the earlier one behind); a client `DELETE` (clear-all, dismiss) touches only the target on screen.
- **Tombstones**: the target key's tombstone guards the whole logical draft — a save at or below it is rejected under BOTH keys (PR mode answers `409 { ok: false, found, draftGeneration }` instead of swallowing it), and a patch-key copy at or below it is not served.
- **In-place switches**: `/api/pr-switch` and `/api/pr-diff-scope` responses carry `draftState: { found, draftGeneration }` for the new keys. The client's `adoptDraftTarget` raises its generation to that floor (otherwise every save after switching onto a previously submitted target would be refused). When the target holds a draft, the hook loads it and AUTO-MERGES its items into the session through `onDraftTargetMerge` (skipping ids the session already holds or deleted this session; the app re-checks their anchors and shows a small non-blocking toast), then autosave saves the merge normally — no banner after a switch. The only wait: while that read is in flight, autosave skips writing under the new target (it would overwrite a draft it has not read). Each read is two attempts, each bounded by `TARGET_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS` (5s), so a hung `GET /api/draft` fails instead of pausing autosave. If both attempts fail, the target counts as unreadable: autosave still never writes over it, and instead retries the read on each later save attempt, saving normally once a read succeeds. The next switch (or unmount) supersedes all of this, so nothing can stick. A per-switch counter makes a stale load from an earlier target a no-op. The page-load restore banner is unchanged.

Client side (`packages/review-editor`, `utils/codeAnnotationAnchor.ts`): in PR mode `withPRContext` records on each line comment `anchorText` (the anchored lines), `anchorContext` (two lines before and after on the same side plus the hunk header's function context, so a common line like `}` is not "still valid" by coincidence) and `anchorSnapshot` (the review snapshot id whose coordinates it uses). `reanchorCodeAnnotations` runs on restore (every in-scope line comment when `patchChanged`) and whenever the snapshot on screen changes: a comment whose text and context still match at the same side/lines is re-stamped; any other in-scope line comment, including one with no anchor fields, gets `outdated: true` and keeps its old line numbers (never dropped, never moved). File and general comments, and comments bound to another PR or scope, pass through. The app remembers the latest layer snapshot per PR, and `buildReviewSubmission` posts a line comment inline unless `canPostInline` refuses it: an outdated comment, or one stamped on a snapshot other than the one the page KNOWS for its PR. No evidence is not evidence of change: an unstamped comment, or one for a PR whose snapshot this page has not seen (after a reload only the PR on screen is known), posts inline. Refused comments go in the review body with the code they were written on; only a comment an anchor check marked outdated carries `OUTDATED_ANNOTATION_LABEL`. Restoring a draft whose patch changed does not restore Viewed marks on files still in the diff (`restorableViewedFiles`: the draft cannot tell which files the push touched), and every `/api/feedback` post, the platform path's status post included, carries `draftGeneration`. Outdated comments are not drawn on the diff (the review-state context filters them), show an "Outdated" chip and an Edit action in the sidebar, export under `OUTDATED_ANNOTATION_LABEL`, and a sidebar click opens their file without a scroll request.

### Image previews in code review (#1598)

A changed image whose patch chunk has no hunks (git's binary stub, our oversized stub, or a header-only GitHub/GitLab fallback chunk) renders as a Before/After preview (`packages/review-editor/components/ImageDiffPreview.tsx`) instead of the "Binary or oversized file" notice, in the single-file view and the all-files view, when the server advertises `imagePreviewSupported`. Added files show After only, deleted files Before only, identical bytes (pure rename, mode change) one pane plus "Contents unchanged"; panes stack under ~480px of width, in the compact shell, and for tall images. Cards fetch only once near the viewport (IntersectionObserver), abort on unmount, and keep a 64-entry object-URL LRU per snapshot; SVG is only ever shown through `<img src=blob:…>`. The notices stay the fallback: not an image → binary notice, an oversized stub over 10 MB → oversized notice. The all-files view takes the preview through a `renderImagePreview` render prop that only the review app's all-files panel sets, so the guide chain and the guides.show viewer keep the plain notice and never request images.

Freshness: the endpoint checks the snapshot id only, not a per-image VCS fingerprint (that probe per image would be expensive on a large PR). So for a working-tree side (uncommitted, unstaged, since-base, local-vs-remote, GitButler workspace) the After pane can show a file NEWER than the diff on screen if it changed after the snapshot; the "Diff out of date · Refresh" banner (the 5s `/api/diff/fresh` poll) covers that case, and a refresh re-binds every card to the new snapshot. Server reads run behind a 4-wide limiter that takes the request's abort signal (Bun `req.signal`, Pi the response `close`), so reads queued for cards the reviewer scrolled past are dropped before they run, and no platform API call starts for a request that is gone. The client cache holds at most 64 sides and 128 MB, never revokes an object URL a mounted `<img>` still uses, and ignores a response that arrives after the page moved to another snapshot.

Server side, every decision is in `packages/shared/review-image.ts` (vendored to Pi): eligibility via `findPatchFileEntry`, caps (`MAX_REVIEW_IMAGE_PREVIEW_BYTES` 10 MB, `MAX_REVIEW_IMAGE_PREVIEW_PIXELS` 50 MP, both in `packages/core/diff-paths.ts`), sniffing, header dimensions, error mapping and headers; both servers only say where the current mode reads a side, behind a 4-wide read limiter. Which object each side is comes from ONE table per VCS shared with hunk expansion: `resolveDiffSideSources` (git), `resolveJjSideRevs` (jj), `resolveGitButlerSideSources`; bytes come from `readDiffSideBytes` (`git cat-file --batch-check` then `cat-file blob <oid>`, never `show`; worktree reads refuse symlinks and require the realpath inside the repository toplevel) over the optional runtime methods `runGitBytes` / `readFileBytes` / `realPath` / `runJjBytes` (absent means unavailable). PR mode reads the local checkout at the fixed merge-base/head commits first and falls back to `fetchPRFileBytes` (GitHub contents API, then the blobs API for files over 1 MB after a size check; GitLab JSON files API), base64 in both cases so bytes survive the CLI's text stdout. Workspace mode delegates per child repo (`WorkspaceReviewSession.getFileBytes`). Off: static patch, P4, the guide chain and guides.show.

### GitButler review invariants

GitButler is a distinct VCS provider, ordered after JJ and before Git in both Bun and Pi. It is selected only while symbolic `HEAD` is `refs/heads/gitbutler/workspace` (or legacy `gitbutler/integration`) and the repository has GitButler's local target-ref configuration; a leftover database or an ordinary branch with the reserved name is not detection. An active workspace requires `but >= 0.21.0` on `PATH`, and a missing/incompatible CLI is an explicit error rather than a fallback to ordinary Git staging against the synthetic workspace commit. `--gitbutler` forces this provider; `--git` remains the escape hatch.

The default `gitbutler:workspace` view is GitButler's reported merge base versus the working tree plus untracked files, so it includes every applied committed change and assigned/unassigned worktree change. Multi-branch stack views are committed-only merge-base→stack-tip Git diffs; branch views are committed-only first-parent segment diffs. Client IDs encode branch-name anchors, never GitButler's transient CLI IDs. Do not concatenate independent GitButler hunks: their bases can differ. Assigned worktree hunks stay in Workspace until GitButler exposes an authoritative combined stack diff.

GitButler assignment is not the Git index, so the provider never opts into stage/unstage. Git-status sections, commit history, remote-base discovery/fetch, and the first-run Git setup remain `vcsType: "git"` only. File expansion uses the exact object range for committed views and merge-base/working-tree pair for Workspace; fingerprints cover the visible Git content plus canonical stack/branch topology. Nested multi-repo mode maps only `workspace-current` to GitButler; staged/unstaged/last modes are unavailable when a GitButler child is present.

### Code-review Ask AI context

Ask AI's "changes under review" context for **code review** is generated by the shared agent-review prompt machine (`buildAgentReviewUserMessage` / `buildAgentReviewUserMessageForTarget` in `packages/server/agent-review-message.ts`) — the same machine the launchable review jobs use — and is **delivered on the user's messages, not the system prompt**. The review server computes it for the current view (`buildCurrentAiReviewContext` in `packages/server/review.ts`, mirrored in `apps/pi-extension/server/serverReview.ts`) and ships it as `aiReviewContext` in the diff payloads (`/api/diff` and the switch/PR endpoints). The client (`packages/review-editor`) latches it onto each question via `buildReviewContextPreamble` (`packages/ui/utils/aiPrompt.ts`): the full block on the first message and whenever the view changes, a short reminder otherwise (never re-pasting a large diff). This keeps the agent looking at exactly the on-screen changeset across every mode (uncommitted/untracked, branch, merge-base, stacked-PR full-stack, hide-whitespace, PR worktrees, workspace, GitButler, jj). The code-review system prompt (`buildCodeReviewPrompt` in `packages/ai/context.ts`) is intentionally role-only.

## Ask AI Provider Defaults

Ask AI providers are detected independently from installed/authenticated local CLIs, then the UI picks a default from the detected Plannotator origin. The mapping lives in `packages/core/agents.ts` (re-exported via the `packages/shared/agents.ts` shim) and is applied by `packages/ui/utils/aiProvider.ts`:

| Origin | Preferred Ask AI provider |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `claude-code` | `claude-agent-sdk` |
| `amp` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `droid` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `codex` | `codex-sdk` |
| `opencode` | `opencode-sdk` |
| `pi` | `pi-sdk` |
| `copilot-cli` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `gemini-cli` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |

Automatic resolution is session-only and never writes a preference. Explicit per-origin choices are persisted in cookies, so a user can override the automatic match for one agent without changing the default for another.

**Model lists come from the installed tools, not hand lists.** Claude's list is the SDK's `supportedModels()` against the installed `claude` (a throwaway process with no prompt, `settingSources: []` so no user hooks run, no MCP servers, 10s cap, ~0.5s measured); Codex's is the app-server `model/list`. Both run lazily behind the provider initializer (`?activate=` or the first session), never at startup; a success is kept for the process, a failure may be retried after 60s (`createBestEffortOnce`), and the capabilities answer marks each such provider's list `modelsSource: 'fallback' | 'discovered'` so the client forgets a fallback answer and retries on its next load. Both runtimes share `createDeferredModelDiscovery`: an `?activate=` probe waits for discovery, and so does a session for every provider except Claude, whose sessions resolve the model against the current list while discovery finishes in the background, so the first Ask AI answer does not wait on it — except when that list is still the fallback and lacks the requested pick (e.g. `opus[1m]`), where the session waits for discovery rather than silently running a different model once. One shape, `CatalogModel` in `packages/core/model-catalog.ts` (id, label, efforts + default effort, fast mode, `resolvedId`), serves Ask AI AND the review / Code Tour / Guided Review launchers: `useModelCatalogs` (`packages/ui/hooks/`) fetches the same `/api/ai/capabilities?activate=` answer for the ONE engine a launcher is set to, and `useAgentSettings` resolves saved picks against it at read time (the cookie is never rewritten). ONE resolver, `resolveModelChoice`, is used by the launchers, Ask AI's client (`aiProvider.ts`) and the AI session endpoint: exact id → the alias whose `resolvedId` covers it → the same family's alias (`claude-opus-5` → `opus`) → the surface default (Claude `opus` for review, `sonnet` for tour/guide; Codex `''` = the model the Codex list marks default) → the catalog default; it never moves a pick onto a `[1m]` id unless the pick was one. Efforts clamp to the model's own levels, launches wait until the catalog settles, and a loading row shows meanwhile. The Claude catalog drops the SDK's `default` pointer row and adds a bare latest alias per family offered, and always offers `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` (some CLIs, e.g. Claude Code 2.1.141, name Opus only through the `default` row, whose description then supplies the version); alias labels carry the version parsed from the row's `resolvedModel` (`claudeModelVersion`: "Opus 5.5 (latest)"), since the SDK's `displayName` has none. Codex fast mode is dropped when resolution replaces a saved model with a different one; changing Fast or reasoning then re-keys the section to the model shown. Codex fast support is read from `serviceTiers` (a `priority`/`fast` tier) as well as the deprecated `additionalSpeedTiers`. The only static lists are the small `CLAUDE_FALLBACK_MODELS` / `CODEX_FALLBACK_MODELS`, used when discovery fails.

> **Codex transport note:** the `codex-sdk` provider id is a stable identifier only — it no longer uses `@openai/codex-sdk` / `codex exec`. It drives a long-lived `codex app-server` process over JSON-RPC (`packages/ai/providers/codex-app-server.ts`), which respects the user's/enterprise-managed approval policy and supports interactive Allow/Deny approvals. The id stays `codex-sdk` to preserve saved cookie preferences, the `agents.ts` mapping, and the UI reasoning-effort gate.

> **OpenCode transport note:** the `opencode-sdk` provider spawns its own `opencode serve` per process on an OS-assigned port (`port: 0`) and never attaches to a server it did not spawn (an attached server can't be cleaned up by us, and opencode's per-directory instances accumulate in it without eviction). The spawned server is closed on dispose and on process exit. Model discovery is deferred behind the provider initializer (`?activate=` from the model picker, or the first opencode session) exactly like Codex — nothing spawns at server boot, so the picker lists opencode with an empty model list until first activation. Regression-pinned by `packages/ai/providers/opencode-sdk.test.ts`.

## Annotate Flow

```
User runs /plannotator-annotate <file.md | file.html | https://... | folder/>
        ↓
Claude Code: plannotator annotate subcommand runs
OpenCode/Pi: event handler intercepts command
        ↓
Input type detected:
  .md/.mdx/.txt → file read from disk
  plain-text config/data formats (.yaml .yml .json .jsonc .json5 .toml .ini .cfg .conf .properties .csv .tsv .log .xml .env.example)
             → read from disk, rendered as plain text exactly like .txt (.env itself is
               deliberately excluded — it commonly holds secrets and annotate history
               copies file contents; source-code extensions stay with code review)
             All single-file annotate reads and /api/doc document serves are capped at
             2MB (`MAX_ANNOTATABLE_FILE_BYTES` in `packages/core/annotatable.ts`) —
             larger files get a clear "File too large to annotate (max 2MB)" error.
             Extra extensions listed in `markdownExtensions` (config-only setting,
             e.g. `.livemd`) join this set and render as markdown, frontmatter stripped.
  .mmd/.mermaid → file read, rendered as ONE Mermaid diagram in the full
             diagram viewer (see "Diagram files" below) — not as text
  .dot/.gv   → same, through the Graphviz engine
  .html/.htm → file read, rendered as raw HTML by default (or converted to markdown with --markdown)
  https://   → fetched via Jina Reader (default) or fetch+Turndown (--no-jina)
  http://localhost:* (also 127.x and [::1])
             → LIVE app annotation by default when a quick probe returns HTML:
               the running app is mirrored through a loopback reverse proxy and
               annotated in place (see "Live app annotation" below). --static
               forces the classic conversion pipeline; --app forces live mode
               and fails loudly when it cannot apply.
  folder/    → file browser opened, files converted on demand
        ↓
Annotate server starts (reuses plan editor HTML with mode:"annotate")
        ↓
User annotates content, provides feedback
        ↓
Send Feedback → annotations sent to agent session
Done / Approve (gate) → positive decision recorded (see the decision control below)
```

### Annotate header decision control

Every annotate surface's header decision is one adaptive split control, `DecisionControl`
(`packages/ui/components/DecisionControl.tsx`), rendered from the pure `buildDecisionSpec`
state→spec mapping (`packages/ui/utils/decisionSpec.ts`) beside a ghost-X Close: `Done` (or
`Approve` in gate mode) with nothing to send, `Send Feedback` otherwise, with the alternate
decisions and the in-place note composer behind the caret. One `submitPrimaryDecision()` callback
serves the header primary, the global `Mod+Enter` handler, and the compact primary row, so
keyboard and header can never disagree. Transport routing is pure in
`packages/editor/annotateDecision.ts`: `Done` and every note post `/api/feedback` (a note becomes
a `GLOBAL_COMMENT` at submit time with a one-render deferred submit — zero server change), so
`formatAnnotateOutcome` shapes and strict-gate exit codes are byte-identical to the old
keyboard-only zero submit; only gate-mode approvals reach `/api/approve`. The non-gated empty
menu carries a single composer, "Send a note…" (maintainer ruling: the old "Done with a note…" /
"Request changes…" pair differed only by framing on the same transport and was collapsed into
one item); the approval-framing sentence (`buildCompleteAnnotateFeedback`'s `approvalFraming`)
now serves only the non-gated discard path, and the only confirm left is the
explicit `Done/Approve, discard n annotations…` menu item (plus the pre-existing
close-with-content warning). Compact/touch rows are generated from the same spec, so a visible
positive decision exists in every state; composer rows open `DecisionNoteDialog`. The header flip
predicate is `hasFeedbackToSend`, so feedback already delivered through the agent terminal shows
the positive primary rather than a stale Send Feedback.

### Annotate Options menu and Settings parity

Annotate renders the same document app as plan review, so its Options menu and
Settings dialog match plan review item for item; only rows that describe a PLAN
decision stay plan-only. Settings `mode="annotate"` shows General, Theme,
Display (width reads "Document Width"), Saving, Labels, Vim, Shortcuts, Files,
Obsidian, Bear and Octarine — gated on the optional `annotateParity` prop,
which `AppHeader` passes and a `@plannotator/ui` host that omits it does not
(hosts keep the pre-parity annotate tab set; see `packages/ui/HANDOFF.md`).
The notes-app enable switches are the SAME cookies plan review's approve reads
(`body.obsidian`/`bear`/`octarine`), so enabling one from annotate also makes
plan review save every approved plan there; the annotate description says so
explicitly. Plan-only, and hidden in annotate: the **Hooks**
tab (plan-time hooks; `/api/hooks/status` exists only on the plan server),
**Save Plans** (decision snapshots in `plans/` are written on approve/deny),
the three **Auto-save on Plan Arrival** switches (the arrival auto-save effect
is gated `!annotateMode`), **Permission Mode**, and OpenCode **Agent
Switching** (annotate decisions never send `agentSwitch`). The Archive sidebar
tab stays plan-only too (the annotate server has no `/api/archive/*`).

**Agent Instructions** (Options menu) is offered in every annotate session.
`buildAnnotateAgentInstructions(origin, surface)`
(`packages/ui/utils/annotateAgentInstructions.ts`) is the annotate twin of
`buildPlanAgentInstructions` (plan text is unchanged): same endpoint and
plan-mode validator, "document" not "plan", no deny/resubmit loop, and one
section per surface picked by `resolveAnnotateInstructionsSurface` — its own
read command (`.plan`; `.rawHtml` for raw HTML; `.targetUrl` for a live app;
`/api/doc?path=<p>&doc=1 | jq -r '.markdown // .rawHtml'` for a folder, so
HTML and data files print too) plus the targeting rules the validator actually
supports: `diagramAnchor` on POST for diagram files, `htmlAnchor` by PATCH
only (POST drops it), `pageUrl` by PATCH for live-app routes. Folder sessions
are stated plainly: an external comment cannot target a document; it lists in
the panel whichever document is open, is not highlighted inline, and rides the
submitted feedback. Not done yet: POST accepting `htmlAnchor`, and a `path`
field so a folder-session external comment targets one document.
`packages/server/annotate-agent-instructions.test.ts`
executes every curl/JSON example in the text against a real annotate server,
so an instruction that drifts from the server fails there.

Save to Obsidian / Bear / Octarine menu items are hidden (a `Mod+S` quick save
toasts instead) when the session has no document text (`notesSaveAvailable`: raw-HTML, live-app, a
folder with no file open) — the server skips an empty `plan`, so those items
were silent no-ops.

### Tolerant argument resolution

Slash-command hosts forward raw user words to `plannotator annotate` verbatim (on Claude Code through a bash-substitution prefix that runs before the model sees anything), so non-strict invocations resolve their arguments in three tiers. The shared logic lives in `packages/shared/annotate-target.ts` (vendored to Pi) and is wired into the CLI's annotate branch plus the OpenCode and Pi command parsers:

1. A single-token invocation runs the classic pipeline unchanged: a bare correct path behaves exactly as before, and a lone typo'd path still fails with `File not found` and exit `1`.
2. With several tokens, each token is probed; exactly one naming an existing file, URL, or folder proceeds with it (`annotate look at notes.md please` opens `notes.md`). Two or more resolving tokens error naming every candidate rather than guessing, which also means `annotate a.md b.md` (previously: silently opened `a.md`, ignoring `b.md`) is now that error. Bare directory names only count as targets when they are the sole argument, so a stray word matching a directory (or `.`) cannot hijack the fast path; unrecognized dash-prefixed tokens disable the tolerance entirely so a typo'd flag (`--no-jna`) errors the way it always did instead of being silently skipped.
3. When nothing resolves, the CLI emits an agent-addressed handoff that echoes the words tried and asks the reading agent to re-run with a concrete target (content flags such as `--markdown` / `--no-jina` / `--render-html` are echoed for the re-run; transport flags are not). In plain mode the handoff goes to **stdout with exit `0`**, because a non-zero exit from a Claude Code bang-prefix skill aborts the prompt before the model sees any output; with `--json` / `--hook` it goes to stderr with exit `1` so machine-readable stdout stays reserved for decision records. OpenCode and Pi surface the same message as a host notification.

Strict invocations (`--require-approval` / `--result-file`) bypass all three tiers: `args[1]` is the target and a typo'd path stays a startup failure with exit `2`.

The bang prefix in the Claude Code skill is deliberate: #872 (commit `aac5aacb`, "restore `/plannotator-*` bash execution on Claude Code") put it back so the slash command never depends on the model choosing to run the binary. Argument-shape problems belong here in the CLI's resolution, not in the skill templates.

### Strict direct annotate results

Direct `plannotator annotate` invocations may add `--require-approval` and/or `--result-file <path>` only with `--gate --json`; both reject `--hook` and are not shared with OpenCode/Pi slash-command parsing. When neither strict option is present, single-target invocations keep the legacy plaintext, JSON, hook, and exit behavior unchanged; multi-token invocations go through the tolerant tiers described under "Tolerant argument resolution" above.

Strict decisions use one newline-terminated JSON record on stdout and, when requested, identical bytes in the result file. Exit codes follow the grep convention: approval exits `0`; with `--require-approval`, annotated and dismissed decisions are published before exiting `1` (negative human outcome); usage/startup/validation failures — bad flag combinations, strict flags outside `annotate --gate --json`, a missing `--result-file` parent, a pre-existing or dangling-symlink destination, and every annotate startup failure (missing path, unreachable URL, empty folder, ambiguous name, missing file, oversized file) — exit `2` (the gate itself was misconfigured or could not start). Those startup sites exit `1` as before for non-strict invocations, with one deliberate exception: the multi-token zero-resolve handoff is not a startup failure, so in plain non-strict mode it prints on stdout and exits `0` (under `--json`/`--hook` it stays stderr + exit `1`). Under a strict flag `1` is reserved for "the reviewer did not approve", so a typo'd path must never masquerade as a rejection. Post-decision publication failures (destination appears between validation and publish, hard links unavailable) also exit `2`: the result *file* was not published, so they present as environment errors — "the gate could not publish its result" — never as a reviewer outcome, and never as approval (still fail-closed, since only `0` means approved). The stdout decision record is written **before** result-file publication and is still emitted whenever the decision itself completed; only a stdout write failure leaves no record anywhere. Signal deaths keep `128+n`. Result paths resolve from the invocation working directory, require an existing parent and absent destination, and publish via a flushed/closed `0600` same-directory temporary file plus an atomic no-clobber hard link—never copy or overwrite fallback (the `0600` mode is a no-op on Windows, and the atomic link/rename is not followed by a parent-directory fsync, so publication is atomic but not crash-durable). Keep reviewed sources at stable project paths; unique result and diagnostic log files may use a narrow temporary directory. Explicit Close emits `dismissed`; missing results or process/browser failures are recovery cases, never approval.

### Abandoned strict gate sessions

Local direct structured gates (`--gate --json`, not `--hook`, not remote) advertise a client lease in `/api/plan` and serve `/api/annotate/client-lease` (SSE, `ANNOTATE_CLIENT_LEASE_STREAM_PATH`). Each open stream is one connected review surface; the server heartbeats every 5s and, once at least one client has connected, starts a 30s reconnect grace when the last one disconnects. A reconnect inside the grace continues the same review; expiry resolves the gate as the same `dismissed` decision an explicit Close produces, except that it keeps the saved annotation draft so an abandoned review can still be recovered. Approve, feedback, explicit exit, and server stop all cancel a pending expiry. Whichever producer settles the session first wins: every one of them (each connected surface and the expiry itself) goes through a single one-shot settlement, so a decision arriving after the session already resolved is rejected with `409` rather than deleting the draft and reporting success for an outcome the caller never received. Page lifecycle events are deliberately not used: `pagehide`/`beforeunload` also fire on reload and navigation, so they cannot distinguish abandonment from a reconnect. A session that never receives its first client never auto-dismisses, so browser-launch failures still need a caller-side timeout, and remote/shared sessions keep the capability off because tunnel disconnects would read as abandonment — as do `--tailscale`-published sessions, which force local mode but are reached through the serve proxy, whose disconnects would read the same way.

### Live app annotation (annotate-app)

Live local app annotation (spec: `adr/research/SPIKE-local-app-annotation-20260810.md`, section 7; phase 1 shipped it on the Bun path, phase 2 brought the Pi extension to parity). `plannotator annotate http://localhost:5173` probes the loopback URL (3s timeout, `accept: text/html`) and, when the probe returns an HTML page, starts server mode `"annotate-app"` instead of converting the page: a dedicated loopback reverse proxy mirrors the whole dev-server origin on its own `127.0.0.1` port, injects `<script src="/__plannotator__/bridge.js">` into every HTML response (streaming, exactly once per document), and passes WebSockets through so HMR keeps working. Every proxy DECISION — the injector state machine, loopback/Host/Origin predicates, CSP/X-Frame-Options policy, redirect rewrite, WS origin gate, bridge assembly, `liveAppDraftIdentity` — lives once in `packages/shared/live-proxy-core.ts`; `packages/server/live-proxy.ts` is the Bun transport over it and `packages/shared/live-proxy-node.ts` (vendored to Pi) is the `node:http` transport, whose WS passthrough replays the client's own handshake upstream over raw TCP and pipes the sockets byte-for-byte. The probe itself (timeout, `< 500` status gate, final-response redirect rule) and every user-facing live-mode message are shared too, in `packages/shared/live-probe.ts`. The editor renders the proxied app full-viewport in an unsandboxed iframe and drives the same pinpoint annotation experience the srcdoc surface provides. `--static` forces the classic conversion; `--app` forces live and errors loudly wherever it cannot apply: non-loopback, https, unreachable, non-HTML, off-origin-redirecting, and non-URL (file/folder) targets. "Loopback" means `localhost`, `::1`, or a LITERAL IPv4 address in 127.0.0.0/8 (`isLoopbackHostname` in `live-proxy-core.ts`, the single source of truth); DNS names like `127.0.0.1.evil.example` are not loopback. Live eligibility is judged on the probe's FINAL response after redirects: a target that 302s off its own loopback origin (auth portal, tunnel splash, another local port) falls back to the static pipeline instead of opening a dead live surface, while same-server redirects stay live-eligible.

The advertised `appUrl` is the proxy under its LOCALHOST spelling with the target URL's own path and query (`http://localhost:<B>/admin?tab=2`): localhost keeps the framed app same-site with the editor page and shares the dev app's host-only localhost cookies and storage, which a `127.0.0.1` spelling would not (Safari ITP would then block all cookies in the cross-site iframe). The proxy still BINDS the `127.0.0.1` literal; browsers that resolve localhost to `::1` first fall back to IPv4 on the refused loopback connect.

**Runtime coverage:** the feature ships on the Bun server + Claude Code CLI path AND on the Pi extension (`/plannotator-annotate http://localhost:5173` probes live-first through the shared `live-probe` module, recognizes `--app`/`--static` via `parseAnnotateArgs`'s `liveFlags` opt-in, and surfaces the probe-fallback notice through Pi's notifier; `apps/pi-extension/server/serverAnnotate.ts` serves the same `annotate-app` `/api/plan` payload over the vendored Node live proxy). The OpenCode slash-command parser is still untouched: its URL targets keep static conversion, and it deliberately does NOT opt into `liveFlags`, so a typo'd `--app` there stays a visible "File not found" instead of being silently swallowed. Pi has no `--tailscale`, so its hard-off matrix is remote-mode only (command-side notify + server throw + unconditional loopback bind).

**Session shape:** the surface opens with pinpoint **armed**, and it is comment-only; the full interaction contract it shares with raw-HTML sessions is documented once under "## Annotation System" below. Two things are specific to live mode: vim navigation is off outright (`vimModeEnabled={liveApp ? false : ...}`, `packages/editor/App.tsx:5484`), because its keyboard cursor writes into the app's own DOM, and the viewer's floating input-method switch is not offered. Text drag-selection commenting is NOT disabled: it stays live in both the armed and Interact states, exactly as on raw HTML. Multi-page sessions are supported in one server session: annotations carry `pageUrl` (pathname + search, capped at 2048), restore filters to the current page, the export groups feedback under per-page headings while numbering stays global, and the bridge reports SPA navigations via a coalesced `page-change` message. Version history, durable submission records, URL sharing, portable HTML export, Obsidian/Bear save, and the annotate agent terminal are all off, exactly like URL sessions. Drafts, feedback, approve, gates, and the client lease work unchanged.

**Security posture:** the proxy binds `127.0.0.1` unconditionally and validates the `Host` header before touching upstream (DNS-rebinding blunting); `PLANNOTATOR_URL_HOST` is never applied to the proxy origin. WebSocket upgrades whose browser `Origin` header is present and does not name the proxy itself are refused before any upstream contact, so a hostile page's cross-site WS connect is never laundered into the origin-less shape dev servers trust as a non-browser client (Vite CVE-2025-24010 class); header-less non-browser clients pass. App CSP on HTML responses is dropped and replaced with a `frame-ancestors` policy listing exactly the editor origins (amending an arbitrary CSP for an injected script is unpredictable; dev servers rarely ship one; `<meta http-equiv>` CSP is a documented non-goal); `X-Frame-Options` is stripped only on those same HTML responses, so non-HTML responses keep whatever framing protection the app shipped. `/__plannotator__/bridge.js` embeds the per-session token, so its delivery refuses `Sec-Fetch-Site` values other than `same-origin`/`none` (defense in depth against off-origin `<script src>` token reads; header-less clients pass). Upstream redirect `Location`s are re-anchored onto the proxy by loopback-host-plus-port equivalence, never by string prefix. The injected bridge authenticates both message directions with a per-session token plus origin checks, and posts each outbound message once per listed editor origin (the browser delivers only the one matching the parent document, so an editor opened at `127.0.0.1` works too); the parent side keeps every existing size cap. Remote mode is a hard-off with three independent layers and no override env var: the CLI exits with a startup failure suggesting `--static` (on Pi, the command notifies with the same shared message), `startAnnotateServer` throws (both the Bun server and the Pi mirror), and neither transport's proxy bind ever follows `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` — both bind the `127.0.0.1` literal unconditionally, asserted at source level by their test suites. `--tailscale` sessions are hard-off the same way (CLI startup failure + server throw, keyed on `tailnetPublished`): the annotate server stays loopback-bound but is published across the tailnet through the serve proxy, and a live proxy would relay the user's authenticated dev app to every tailnet peer — the same reasoning that defaults the annotate agent terminal off for tailnet-published sessions. Release-note-worthy behavior change: under `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE`, `plannotator annotate http://localhost:...` previously converted the page silently and now exits with that startup failure asking for `--static`.

**Live restore resilience:** a `find-and-mark` that resolves nothing in live mode keeps its record, seeded with unresolved placeholder targets from the durable anchor/text params, so the mutation-driven reconcile re-acquires the pin once a lazy route or data-dependent tree finishes rendering. Srcdoc restores keep the old fail-closed drop (a static document would never re-resolve).

**Known limitations (documented, not bugs):** hardcoded absolute origins in the app, origin-pinned CORS to secondary APIs, and OAuth `redirect_uri` flows land outside the proxy; frame-busting apps break the wrapper; content-encoded HTML that survives the encoding strip renders without the bridge; cross-page annotation clicks do not navigate; a redirect to a DIFFERENT loopback service (another port) is passed through un-rewritten and the iframe leaves the proxy, which is why the probe refuses such targets up front. Manual smoke loop: `scripts/live-annotate-smoke.sh` (not CI).

The body is allowlisted and field-validated by `validateAnnotationPatch` (`@plannotator/core/external-annotation`, both runtimes) with the SAME validators POST applies — `diagramAnchor` / `htmlAnchor` / `elementContext` / the target arrays through their own fail-closed parsers, `inReplyTo` through `validateReplyTarget`, the scalars by type and cap. A bad value is `400`, unknown keys are dropped, `id` and `source` stay immutable, and `null` clears an optional field but is refused on an anchor or a structural one |
| `/api/external-annotations` | DELETE | Remove by `?id=`, `?source=`, or clear all |

### Review Server (`packages/server/review.ts`)

| Endpoint              | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/diff`           | GET    | Returns `{ rawPatch, gitRef, snapshotId, origin, mode?, diffType, base, hideWhitespace, gitContext, agentCwd?, approvalNotesSupported, semanticDiff?, callFlow?, sections?, commitInfo?, generatedFiles?, baseBehindRemote? }`. `snapshotId` identifies this diff snapshot; the client echoes it on `/api/diff/fresh` probes (also returned by the switch/PR endpoints). `approvalNotesSupported` is the approve-with-notes capability advert (echoed on `/api/diff/switch`, `/api/pr-diff-scope`, and `/api/pr-switch` too, so it survives a diff switch); absent reads as false. `sections` is the since-base sidecar (Committed/Changes/Untracked partition); `commitInfo` is the commit-metadata sidecar (subject, markdown body, author + avatar) present only while a `commit:<sha>` diff is active; `generatedFiles` lists the repo-relative paths that count as generated, which the client collapses by default GitHub-style (presentation-only: the patch is never filtered). Two-layer detection (`packages/shared/generated-files.ts`, vendored to Pi): built-in name defaults (`DEFAULT_GENERATED_PATTERNS` — lockfiles like `bun.lock`/`package-lock.json`/`Cargo.lock`, plus `*.min.js`/`*.min.css`/`*.map`, matched against the path's last segment) apply in every mode with no git needed, and explicit `.gitattributes` `linguist-generated` refines them in BOTH directions via one batched `git check-attr --stdin` at the review cwd (set/true marks any file, unset/false un-marks even a built-in name, unspecified keeps the default). Attribute refinement runs for plain local Git sessions only — PR worktrees, workspace, jj, GitButler, P4, and piped patches get the name-based defaults alone; `baseBehindRemote` flags that the diff base is behind its remote tip. Workspace mode returns `mode: "workspace"` with folder-prefixed paths and no `gitContext`. |
| `/api/diff/switch`    | POST   | Switch diff type, base branch, or whitespace mode (body: `{ diffType, base?, hideWhitespace?, explicitBase? }` — `diffType` includes the `commit:<sha>` family). Also kicks off the rate-limited remote-default/staleness probe fire-and-forget (#1553): this endpoint backs the pickers AND the "Diff out of date · Refresh" button, so it is where a reviewer asks for a fresh answer. Fire-and-forget because a hanging remote must never make a diff switch wait — this response carries the cached `baseBehindRemote` and the next one carries the refreshed value. `explicitBase: true` marks a base the user picked from the picker — the server then honors it verbatim and permanently disables the bare-local-name → `origin/*` canonicalization for the session (echoed bases stay canonicalizable). Response includes `semanticDiff?`, `callFlow?`, `sections?`, `commitInfo?`, `generatedFiles?`, `baseBehindRemote?`, or `{ superseded: true }` when a newer concurrent switch has taken over (client ignores it). |
| `/api/commits`        | GET    | One page of the branch's linear `--first-parent` history for the Commits panel (`?limit=&before=`) → `{ commits, hasMore, base }`. Rows carry `isHead` / `isPastBase` (where the branch meets the active base) and best-effort author `avatarUrl`. Plain local git sessions only (PR/workspace/GitButler/jj/p4 → 400); computed against the active diff's cwd, so worktree sessions list the worktree's history. |
| `/api/diff/fresh`     | GET    | Cheap staleness probe: recomputes the VCS fingerprint captured with the current diff snapshot and returns `{ fresh, fingerprint?, baseBehindRemote?, agentCwd? }`. Strictly **local**: it never contacts the git remote (#1553 — the client polls it every 5s, so the remote probe that used to hang off it made an idle session query the remote once a minute forever). `baseBehindRemote` is carried from the cached value refreshed by the other endpoints. Accepts `?snapshot=<id>` — the client echoes the `snapshotId` it received with its diff, and a mismatch with the server's current snapshot reports stale PER CLIENT (covers the startup base upgrade and cross-tab switches even when the VCS fingerprint matches). `baseBehindRemote` is carried on every response (omitting it would flicker the "behind GitHub" banner); `agentCwd` re-advertises the PR checkout in PR mode. Unfingerprintable modes (e.g. P4) always report fresh to a matching snapshot. Polled by the UI's "Diff out of date · Refresh" notice. |
| `/api/fetch-base`     | POST   | Runs `git fetch` for the base's remote tracking ref, then re-queries the remote tip (fresh `ls-remote`) so narrow-refspec fetches report honestly. Backs the "Baseline is behind GitHub · Fetch" banner. Git-only, base-relative diff types only. |
| `/api/semantic-diff`  | GET    | Runs semantic diff for the active patch and returns parsed sem output or an unavailable/error response (`?fileExt=` / `?fileExts=` optional). |
| `/api/call-flow`      | GET    | Runs snapshot-bound CallDiff analysis for the active Git review (`?snapshot=<id>` required). Returns bounded call trees, raw output, per-file impacts, and explicit skipped-language/file metadata for packs not yet installed. |
| `/api/call-flow/install` | POST | Starts or joins the selective install (`{ languageIds?: [...] }`; omission uses the current review's server-authored plan). The UI calls it automatically once per target per review session after Call flow consent; manual calls remain for Retry and install-ahead. The coordinator deduplicates/queues core and pack targets, a stale-tolerant data-dir lease serializes publication across server processes, Node >= 22 preflight runs before download, and the endpoint enforces the same-origin guard. |
| `/api/call-flow/install-status` | GET | Poll `{ state, stage?, languageIds?, currentLanguageId?, error?, reason? }` across `downloading` / `verifying` / `installing-deps` / `building`. |
| `/api/review-analysis` | GET / POST  | GET refreshes capability adverts without mutating settings; POST persists independent `{ semanticDiff, callFlow }` booleans and returns adverts. |
| `/api/file-content`   | GET    | Returns `{ oldContent, newContent }` for expandable diff context (`?path=&oldPath=&base=`) |
| `/api/review-image`   | GET    | One side of a changed image as raw bytes for the Before/After preview (`?path=&side=old\|new&snapshot=`; #1598). Serves only a file in the current patch whose chunk has no hunks and whose path is `png jpg jpeg gif webp svg avif bmp ico apng`; the old path is taken from the chunk, never the client. `Content-Type` is sniffed from magic bytes; every image response carries `nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox; …` and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`, plus `ETag` (304 on `If-None-Match`) and `X-Image-Width`/`X-Image-Height` when the header parses. Errors are JSON `{ reason, error }`: `400 unavailable\|bad-request`, `404 not-in-diff\|absent\|missing`, `409 stale`, `413 too-large` (10 MB per side or 50 megapixels), `415 not-image\|lfs-pointer`, `502 fetch-failed`. Advertised by `imagePreviewSupported` on every diff payload (false for static-patch and P4 sessions). |
| `/api/git-add`        | POST   | Stage/unstage a file (body: `{ filePath, undo? }`) |
| `/api/feedback`       | POST   | Submit review (body: feedback, annotations, agentSwitch) |
| `/api/image`          | GET    | Serve image by path query param            |
| `/api/upload`         | POST   | Upload image, returns `{ path, originalName }` |
| `/api/draft`          | GET/POST/DELETE | Auto-save annotation drafts to survive server crashes |
| `/api/editor-annotations` | GET | List editor annotations (VS Code only) |
| `/api/editor-annotation` | POST/DELETE | Add or remove an editor annotation (VS Code only) |
| `/api/ai/capabilities` | GET | Check if AI features are available |
| `/api/ai/session` | POST | Create or fork an AI session |
| `/api/ai/query` | POST | Send a message and stream the response (SSE) |
| `/api/ai/abort` | POST | Abort the current query |
| `/api/ai/permission` | POST | Respond to a permission request |
| `/api/ai/sessions` | GET | List active sessions |
| `/api/external-annotations/stream` | GET | SSE stream for real-time external annotations |
| `/api/external-annotations` | GET | Snapshot of external annotations (polling fallback, `?since=N` for version gating) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | POST | Add external annotations (single or batch `{ annotations: [...] }`) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | PATCH | Update fields on a single annotation (`?id=`). The body is allowlisted and field-validated by `validateAnnotationPatch` (`@plannotator/core/external-annotation`, both runtimes) with the SAME validators POST applies — `diagramAnchor` / `htmlAnchor` / `elementContext` / the target arrays through their own fail-closed parsers, `inReplyTo` through `validateReplyTarget`, the scalars by type and cap. A bad value is `400`, unknown keys are dropped, `id` and `source` stay immutable, and `null` clears an optional field but is refused on an anchor or a structural one |
| `/api/external-annotations` | DELETE | Remove by `?id=`, `?source=`, or clear all |
| `/api/agents/capabilities` | GET | Check available agent providers (claude, codex, tour, guide, cursor, opencode, pi, copilot) |
| `/api/agents/review-profiles` | GET | List launchable review profiles (enabled skills + builtin default) |
| `/api/agents/skills` | GET | List all discovered skills for the add-a-review picker (each flagged `enabled`) |
| `/api/agents/review-skills` | POST | Enable a skill as a review (body: `{ name }`); writes `review-skills.json` |
| `/api/agents/guide-instructions` | GET/PUT | Read or replace the Guided Review standing instructions, stored in `${dataDir}/guide-instructions.md` (trimmed, capped; blank PUT deletes). Guide launches whose body carries no `instructions` apply this stored text. |
| `/api/agents/jobs/stream` | GET | SSE stream for real-time agent job status updates |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | GET | Snapshot of agent jobs (polling fallback, `?since=N` for version gating) |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | POST | Launch an agent job (body: `{ provider, command, label, engine?, model?, effort?, reasoningEffort?, thinking?, fastMode?, reviewProfileId?, repairOf?, instructions? }`; `instructions` is guide-only reviewer text appended to the organizer prompt, capped at `GUIDE_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS_MAX_CHARS`; when absent, guide launches apply the server-stored standing instructions) |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | DELETE | Kill all running agent jobs |
| `/api/agents/jobs/:id` | DELETE | Kill a specific agent job |
| `/api/pr-diff-scope` | POST | Switch between layer and full-stack diff scope. Response includes `semanticDiff?`. |
| `/api/pr-list` | GET | List PRs for the current repo (cached 30s) |
| `/api/pr-switch` | POST | Switch to a different PR in-place (body: `{ url }`). Response includes `semanticDiff?`. |
| `/api/tour/:jobId` | GET | Fetch Code Tour result (greeting, stops, checklist) for a completed tour job |
| `/api/tour/:jobId/checklist` | PUT | Persist checklist item state for a Code Tour |
| `/api/guide/:jobId` | GET | Fetch Guided Review result (ordered sections with overviews + file refs) for a completed guide job, or a persisted guide via the `saved:{id}` pseudo job id |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/reviewed` | PUT | Persist per-section reviewed state for a guide (live job ids write through to the job's autosaved file; `saved:{id}` ids persist directly) |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/export` | GET | Download a guide as one portable HTML file (`Content-Disposition: attachment`): live job ids resolve from the session's launch-time review (store fallback), `saved:{id}` from the store. 404 when the guide's diff was not retained (pre-portable envelopes). No size gate. `/api/guide/:jobId/export-info` returns `{ bytes, filename, languages }` for the same resolution. |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/share` | POST | Create a share link for a guide on the guide host (`resolveGuideShareUrl`; guide share hosting contract `adr/implementation/guide-share-hosting.md` §7). Body `{ public?: boolean, ttlSeconds?: number }`, every field optional and an empty body means the defaults: encrypted upload (the key lives only in the returned URL's `#key=` fragment; the host stores ciphertext) unless `public: true` stores the snapshot unencrypted so the hosted page can carry a title and `og:` tags. Resolves the guide exactly like `/export` (launch-time review, `saved:{id}` from the store). `200 { id, url, deleteToken, expiresAt?, bytes, recorded }` where `recorded` says whether the saved envelope now remembers `share: { id, url, createdAt, deleteToken, serviceUrl }` (false without an envelope, e.g. guide history off, in which case only the one-time token can remove the link). `400` bad body, `403 { error: "sharing disabled" }` when `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE=disabled` (also the same-origin guard as other mutating endpoints), `404` when the diff was not retained, `409 { error, url }` when the envelope already records a link (one link per guide: the record is the only place the token lives, so a second upload would orphan the first), `502 { error }` on a service failure (`GuideShareError`). |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/share` | DELETE | Remove the recorded share link: calls the host the record names (`serviceUrl`, never merely the currently configured share URL) with the stored delete token and clears the envelope record. `204`; `404` when no record; a host `404` (already expired or removed elsewhere) still clears the record; other host errors `502`. Same-origin guard. |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/share-info` | GET | `{ enabled, serviceUrl, existing?: { url, createdAt } }`: whether sharing is on (`resolveSharingEnabled`), which host links go to, and the link the saved envelope already records, so the UI can hide "Create share link" or offer Remove link. |
| `/api/guides` | GET | List persisted guides for the current repo: `[{ id, label, title, savedAt, progress: { reviewed, total }, moved }]` — `moved` flags a stored head sha that differs from the head currently under review |
| `/api/guides/:id` | DELETE | Delete a persisted guide. A recorded share link is removed from its host first, best effort: the envelope is the only copy of the delete token, so a host failure is logged with the manual `plannotator guide unshare` command and the delete still proceeds |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/output` | GET | Fetch a failed guide job's captured raw output for manual repair (404 if none captured) |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/submit` | POST | Manually submit corrected guide JSON for a failed job (body: `{ payload }`) |
| `/api/code-nav/resolve` | POST | Search for symbol definitions and references via ripgrep (body: `{ symbol, filePath, line, charStart, side, language? }`) |
| `/api/code-nav/hover` | POST | Token hover card resolution: the same body and the same guards as `/resolve`, over the same ripgrep search, returning one enriched definition (kind, approximate signature, heuristic doc comment, short preview), an optional runner-up candidate, and a five-reference sample. `backend: 'unavailable'` (rg missing) is a normal 200 and the client renders nothing. `source` is always `'search'` in Tier 0; the nullable `symbolKind` / `signature` / `doc` fields are what a later syntax- or index-backed tier would fill. Client-side the card is governed by two cookie-only settings (`packages/ui/config/settings.ts`, types in `@plannotator/core/token-hover`): `tokenHoverTrigger` (`hover` default / `modifier`, meaning the platform's primary modifier held, Cmd on macOS and Ctrl elsewhere via `isModKeyHeld` / `modEventKey` in `packages/ui/utils/platform.ts` / `off`, which withholds the handler props so the diff views wire no listeners at all) and `tokenHoverDelay` (150 / 300 default / 700 ms, the dwell before any request exists; 300 matches the VS Code hover delay). `tokenHoverTrigger` REPLACED the original `tokenHoverCards` boolean and re-reads its cookie as a migration on every load until the user touches the setting (`false` becomes `off`), never writing it back: a migrating read returns a value, so the registry's default-seeding write never fires, and resolution is pure and identical every time. Cmd rather than Alt because Alt is widely bound to push-to-talk dictation (an Alt gate would open cards while the user speaks) and because Cmd+hover is already VS Code's "tell me about this symbol" gesture; the navigable-target underline and the card under one held key is that composite gesture, not a collision, since `handleCodeNavRequest` dismisses the hover surface on every References invocation. Only the modifier ALONE arms: any other key while it is held (Cmd+C) disarms and closes, so a copy with the pointer parked on a token cannot pop a card. Both key branches read `composedPath()[0]`, not `event.target`, because a window-level listener sees the shadow HOST and Pierre's edit-session editor is a contenteditable inside that root; typing suppresses ARMING only, never disarming, and keyup carries no typing guard at all. The `pn-token-nav` affordance is the other half of the held-key gesture: the diff views paint it from the pointer enter event, and the hook additionally reports arm/disarm through `onModifierGate(armed, tokenElement)` so a key pressed over a parked pointer (and the release after it) paints and unpaints it too. `pn-token-hover` (underline plus a `cursor: pointer !important` that beats Pierre's I-beam) is painted by BOTH diff views, gated on a hover handler actually being wired, so `off` and the portable viewer get no affordance. Click behavior is untouched by the trigger setting, and the #1461 Alt+click References alias is unrelated. The stored value stays `modifier`: the setting names the shape of the gate, not which key fills it. |
| `/api/code-nav/file` | GET | Read file from working tree for code-nav preview (`?path=`) |

### Annotate Server (`packages/server/annotate.ts`)

| Endpoint              | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/plan`           | GET    | Returns `{ plan, origin, mode: "annotate", filePath, sourceInfo?, gate, renderAs?, rawHtml?, previousPlan?, versionInfo?, diffCurrent?, diffHtml? }`. `renderAs` is `"markdown"`, `"html"`, or — for a whole-file diagram source (`.mmd`/`.mermaid`/`.dot`/`.gv`) — `"mermaid"` / `"graphviz"`, in which case `plan` is the file's RAW text and the editor renders it as one diagram block (see "Diagram files"). The decision is the pure, shared `annotateDiagramRenderKind` (`packages/core/annotatable.ts`), so a raw-HTML, converted, URL, folder, message or live-app session is never a diagram session in either runtime. The last four power the per-file version diff: `previousPlan`/`versionInfo`/`diffCurrent` for the markdown diff, `diffHtml` (the previous→current page rendered with inline `<ins>`/`<del>`) for `--render-html` files. A local rendered-HTML root is served from its CURRENT bytes on every read (`readRootHtml`), with the startup snapshot as the fallback when the file is missing, unreadable, or over the 2MB cap; when the served bytes differ from the snapshot, `previousPlan`/`versionInfo` still name the saved baseline and `diffCurrent`/`diffHtml` are recomputed against the served bytes (`htmlDiff` is pure; a GET never writes history), so a reload after an agent edit keeps the version diff. `/api/doc` carries the same recomputed `previousPlan`/`versionInfo`/`diffHtml` when it serves that root document (the in-app Refresh path, `rootHtmlVersionDiff`), and nothing extra for any other document. Live app sessions return `{ mode: "annotate-app", appUrl, targetUrl, liveToken, sharingEnabled: false, ... }` instead: no rawHtml, no version fields (see "Live app annotation"). |
| `/api/plan/version`   | GET    | Fetch a specific stored version of the annotated file (`?v=N`) |
| `/api/plan/versions`  | GET    | List all stored versions of the annotated file |
| `/api/feedback`       | POST   | Submit annotations (body: feedback, annotations) |
| `/api/approve`        | POST   | Approve without feedback (review-gate UX, `--gate`) |
| `/api/exit`           | POST   | Close session without feedback |
| `/api/save-notes`     | POST   | Save to external note apps (Obsidian, Bear, Octarine) |
| `/api/html-assets/<token>/<path>` | GET | Serve relative support assets for raw HTML annotation sessions, and the sibling `.html`/`.htm` documents an annotated page EMBEDS (`<iframe>`/`<embed>`/`<object>`/`<frame>`). The served page carries a `<base href>` pointing here, which is what makes relative URLs — including ones a script assigns at runtime — resolve against the document's own directory. HTML responses carry `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts` (no `allow-same-origin`, so an embed can never call this session's API) plus `nosniff`, and honour the 2MB annotate cap; a framed or `.html` failure renders a small 404 document naming the file rather than JSON or the app. See "Embedded local documents" under Annotation System. |
| `/api/share-html`     | GET    | Lazily prepare portable raw HTML for sharing (`?path=<html-file>` optional) |
| `/api/image`          | GET    | Serve image by path query param            |
| `/api/upload`         | POST   | Upload image, returns `{ path, originalName }` |
| `/api/doc`            | GET    | Serve linked .md/.mdx/.html file or code file (`?path=<path>&base=<dir>`). A diagram source carries the same `renderAs: "mermaid" \| "graphviz"` with its raw text as `markdown`, so folder navigation opens it in the diagram viewer too |
| `/api/doc/exists`     | POST   | Batch-validate code-file paths (body: `{ paths: string[], base?: string }`) |
| `/api/skills`         | GET    | List global agent skills for comment skill references (`{ skills: [{ name, root, description?, humanOnly, dir }] }`) |
| `/api/skills/content` | GET    | SKILL.md contents of one discovered skill for human-only feedback injection (`?name=<skill>`) returns `{ skill: { name, dir, path, content, truncated, humanOnly } }`; the name is matched against discovery only, never used as a path |
| `/api/draft`          | GET/POST/DELETE | Auto-save annotation drafts to survive server crashes |
| `/api/annotate/client-lease` | GET (SSE) | Client lease for local direct structured gates: each open stream is one connected review surface. 404 when the capability is not advertised. |
| `/api/agent-terminal/pty/<token>` | WebSocket | Tokenized PTY bridge for the optional annotate-mode agent terminal |
| `/api/ai/capabilities` | GET | Check if AI features are available |
| `/api/ai/session` | POST | Create or fork an AI session |
| `/api/ai/query` | POST | Send a message and stream the response (SSE) |
| `/api/ai/abort` | POST | Abort the current query |
| `/api/ai/permission` | POST | Respond to a permission request |
| `/api/ai/sessions` | GET | List active sessions |
| `/api/external-annotations/stream` | GET | SSE stream for real-time external annotations |
| `/api/external-annotations` | GET | Snapshot of external annotations (polling fallback, `?since=N` for version gating) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | POST | Add external annotations (single or batch `{ annotations: [...] }`) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | PATCH | Update fields on a single annotation (`?id=`). The body is allowlisted and field-validated by `validateAnnotationPatch` (`@plannotator/core/external-annotation`, both runtimes) with the SAME validators POST applies — `diagramAnchor` / `htmlAnchor` / `elementContext` / the target arrays through their own fail-closed parsers, `inReplyTo` through `validateReplyTarget`, the scalars by type and cap. A bad value is `400`, unknown keys are dropped, `id` and `source` stay immutable, and `null` clears an optional field but is refused on an anchor or a structural one |
| `/api/external-annotations` | DELETE | Remove by `?id=`, `?source=`, or clear all |

All servers use random ports locally or fixed port (`19432`) in remote mode.

### Paste Service (`apps/paste-service/`)

| Endpoint              | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/paste`          | POST   | Store compressed plan data, returns `{ id }` |
| `/api/paste/:id`      | GET    | Retrieve stored compressed data            |

Runs as a separate service on port `19433` (self-hosted) or as a Cloudflare Worker (hosted).

## Plan Version History

Every plan is automatically saved to `~/.plannotator/history/{project}/{slug}/` on arrival, before the user sees the UI. Versions are numbered sequentially (`001.md`, `002.md`, etc.). The slug is derived from the plan's first `# Heading` + today's date via `generateSlug()`, scoped by project name (git repo or cwd). Same heading on the same day = same slug = same plan being iterated on. Identical resubmissions are deduplicated (no new file if content matches the latest version).

This powers the version history API (`/api/plan/version`, `/api/plan/versions`) and the plan diff system.

**Annotate mode** also saves history on open, so the same version diff works when annotating a standalone `.md`/`.txt`/`.html` file (or any other supported plain-text file, e.g. `.yaml`/`.json`/`.toml`). It keys the slug by **file path** — `annotate-{sanitized-basename}-{hash8}` — rather than heading + date, so re-opening the same file groups its versions even as its content (and headings) change. **Note this writes a copy of each annotated file's content** under `~/.plannotator/history/` (or `PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR`); disable via `PLANNOTATOR_ANNOTATE_HISTORY=0` or `{ "annotateHistory": false }` in `~/.plannotator/config.json` to keep annotate sessions stateless (the version diff is then unavailable, and the durable submitted-feedback records described in the env-var table are also skipped). Single-local-file annotate sessions additionally write each submitted decision to `history/{project}/{slug}/submissions/{timestamp}.md` BEFORE deleting the annotation draft, so feedback survives an agent-side timeout (#678); a failed record write keeps the draft as the recovery copy. For `--render-html` files the diff is rendered as the real page with inline `<ins>`/`<del>` highlights via `htmlDiff()` (`packages/shared/html-diff.ts`).

History saves independently of the `planSave` user setting (which controls decision snapshots in `~/.plannotator/plans/`). Storage functions live in `packages/shared/storage.ts` (runtime-agnostic, re-exported by `packages/server/storage.ts`). Pi copies the shared files at build time. Slug format: `{sanitized-heading}-YYYY-MM-DD` (heading first for readability).

## Feedback Archive

Every review submitted through a Plannotator decision is durably archived at
decision-settlement time, so a submission survives an agent-side timeout, a
closed terminal, or a `planSave` setting the user turned off. One deliberate
exception: a review posted straight to GitHub or GitLab with `POST
/api/pr-action` is delivered to the platform and is **not** archived locally
yet (a named follow-up). Layout, per project (same `{project}` key as
`history/`):

```
${PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR}/feedback/{project}/
  index.jsonl                                  # append-only, authoritative, schema v1
  records/2026-08-31T14-22-07-511Z-review-feedback.md   # human-readable sidecar
```

The JSONL line is self-contained (`v`, `ts`, `client`, `clientVersion?`,
`project`, `origin`, `surface`, `decision`, `target`, `feedback`,
`annotations`, `counts`, `recordFile`) so an analyzer never has to open a
sidecar; the markdown sidecar exists because the rest of the data dir is
greppable markdown and is written only for records that carry content. Bare
approvals, LGTMs, and dismissals are decision-only lines with no sidecar.

**This index is shared, not Plannotator-private.** Several tools that share the
data dir append to the SAME `feedback/{project}/index.jsonl`, separated by the
`client` field on each line rather than by separate files. Known writers today:
`plannotator` (this repo) and `plannotator-tui`, the Rust terminal client;
`herdr-annotate` is reserved for a possible future Lite writer. Treat `client`
as an open set, never an enum to validate against. Practical consequences: the
line shape is a cross-tool contract, so fields are **added, never repurposed**;
other clients suffix their id onto their sidecar filenames
(`{stamp}-{surface}-{decision}-plannotator-tui.md`), so the `records/`
directory holds more filename shapes than this repo writes and `recordFile` is
the only valid handle to a sidecar (nothing may parse the name); and unknown
fields must be ignored rather than rejected.

Two optional fields are declared in v1 but not populated here, so their names
are reserved across every client: `target.agent` (`{ host?, session?,
transcript? }`) is the provenance for surfaces whose subject is an agent
session rather than a file or a diff, such as annotate-last, and
`clientVersion` is the writing client's own version where it knows it
(`packages/shared` has no runtime-agnostic version constant, so this repo
leaves it unset rather than reading `package.json` from a vendored module).

Everything is written by one shared module, `packages/shared/feedback-archive.ts`
(vendored to Pi as `apps/pi-extension/generated/feedback-archive.ts`), which
resolves the data dir per call and **never throws**: a failed archive write is
logged, degrades silently for the user, and keeps the annotation draft as the
recovery copy. The append happens BEFORE `deleteDraft`, generalizing the #678
ordering to every surface. Call sites: `packages/server/index.ts`
(`/api/approve`, `/api/deny`), `packages/server/review.ts` (`/api/feedback`,
`/api/exit`), `packages/server/annotate.ts` (`persistSubmittedDecision`,
`/api/exit`), and the three Pi mirrors in `apps/pi-extension/server/`.

Invariants worth keeping: records never contain patch bytes or a second copy of
the plan (identity and a version-file reference instead); repeat decisions
append rather than overwrite (unlike the legacy `plans/` snapshot, which is
keyed by slug and status and is left alone); annotation `source` / `author`
provenance is preserved so external, agent, and WebMCP findings stay
distinguishable from the human's own comments; and `feedback` is listed in
`PURGE_OWNED_TOP_LEVEL` (`packages/server/uninstall.ts`) so uninstall purge
removes it. Controls and the privacy/retention note are in the
`PLANNOTATOR_FEEDBACK_HISTORY` row of the environment table above. The read
path in v1 is the files on disk (`jq` over `index.jsonl`, `grep` over
`records/`); there is no CLI reader or UI surface yet.

Details that surprise people:

- **Index durability is a practical guarantee, not a formal one.** One record
  is always exactly one line, and the whole line is handed to a single
  append-mode write. That write is not one syscall (`appendFileSync` loops
  internally until its buffer is drained); what holds in practice is that an
  `O_APPEND` write of a line-sized buffer completes without interleaving on a
  local filesystem. NFS and SMB do not promise even that, and a genuine
  interleave damages **both** records that raced, not just the later one. The
  backstop is the reader: unparsable lines are skipped, so everything else in
  the file still reads. With several clients writing one index, this caveat is
  worth knowing rather than assuming away.
- **Readers gate on structure, not version.** `parseFeedbackIndex` keeps any
  line that parses and carries a numeric `v`, so a newer writer's lines are
  still returned; an analyzer that depends on v1 semantics should filter
  `v <= 1` itself. Since fields are only added and never repurposed, a `v2`
  would signal a real shape change rather than the arrival of new keys.
- **Folder-session records name the folder, not the open document.** A folder
  annotate session submits one body of feedback for the session, so
  `target.filePath` is the session's folder; the per-document path is not part
  of the record.
- **URL-session records store the full URL, query string included**, because
  that is the page that was reviewed. A URL carrying a token in its query is
  therefore written to disk; the opt-out is the control for that.
- **`target.review.cwd` is provenance, not a durable handle.** A PR review
  started with `--local` records a per-PR pool checkout that is cleaned up when
  the session ends; `target.review.pr` plus `gitRef` are the identity that
  survives.
- **Project bucketing prefers the caller's `project` option** (the `project`
  field on `ReviewServerOptions`, mirroring the annotate server), falling back
  to deriving a name from the review cwd. The fallback is wrong in PR mode,
  where there is no `gitContext` and `--local` points `agentCwd` at
  `pool/pr-<n>`, so every CLI entry point passes `detectProjectName()`.
- **The test suite turns the archive off** through the `tests/setup/feedback-archive-off.ts`
  preload in `bunfig.toml`, because most server tests boot a real server
  without redirecting `PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR` and would otherwise write into the
  contributor's own data dir. Tests that need the archive opt back in inside
  their own test bodies.

## Plan Diff

When a user denies a plan and Claude resubmits, the UI shows what changed between versions. A `+N/-M` badge appears below the document card; clicking it toggles between normal view and diff view.

**Diff engine** (`packages/ui/utils/planDiffEngine.ts`): Uses the `diff` npm package (`diffLines()`) to compute line-level diffs. Groups consecutive remove+add into "modified" blocks. Returns `PlanDiffBlock[]` and `PlanDiffStats`.

**Three view modes** (toggle via `PlanDiffModeSwitcher`; `planDiffMode` in `packages/editor/App.tsx` defaults to `classic`):
- **Classic** (`PlanCleanDiffView`, block-level, old above new): Color-coded left borders — green (added), red (removed/strikethrough), yellow (modified). The default.
- **Rendered** (`PlanCleanDiffView` with `wordLevel`, experimental): the same view with word-level inline highlighting.
- **Raw** (`PlanRawDiffView`): Monospace `+/-` lines, git-style

**State** (`packages/ui/hooks/usePlanDiff.ts`): Manages base version selection, diff computation, and version fetching. The server sends `previousPlan` with the initial `/api/plan` response; the hook auto-diffs against it. Users can select any prior version from the sidebar Version Browser.

**Diff annotations:** The clean diff view supports block-level annotation — hover over added/removed/modified sections to annotate entire blocks. Annotations carry a `diffContext` field (`added`/`removed`/`modified`). Exported feedback includes `[In diff content]` labels.

**Annotation hook** (`packages/ui/hooks/useAnnotationHighlighter.ts`): Annotation infrastructure used by `Viewer.tsx`. Manages web-highlighter lifecycle, toolbar/popover state, annotation creation, text-based restoration, and scroll-to-selected. The diff view uses its own block-level hover system instead.

**Sidebar** (`packages/ui/hooks/useSidebar.ts`): Shared left sidebar with three tabs — Table of Contents, Version Browser, and Archive. The "Auto-open Sidebar" setting controls whether it opens on load (TOC tab only). In archive mode, the sidebar opens to the Archive tab automatically.

## Portable Guided Reviews

Decision record: `adr/decisions/007-portable-guided-reviews-20260815.md`; spec: `adr/implementation/portable-guided-reviews.md`.

A guide exports as ONE small HTML file (size ≈ the diff, never the app) that pins a specific viewer build on `guides.show` (`viewer.<hash>.js/.css` + SRI). Format lives in `@plannotator/core/guide-format` (versioned strict snapshot, `createGuideHtml`, fixtures + a compatibility test that must keep parsing every shipped fixture); the pinned build is the generated `@plannotator/core/guide-viewer-manifest` (regenerate with `bun run --cwd apps/guides-show build:viewer && bun run --cwd apps/guides-show sync:manifest`; CI fails if stale).

Invariants: the diff a guide describes is captured when the guide job LAUNCHES (`buildCommand`'s `launchReview`, carried server-side like `changedFilesSnapshot` — never on the SSE-broadcast `AgentJobInfo`) and stored beside the saved guide as `{id}.patch` (patch written before the envelope that references it; deleted together). Exports never read the on-screen diff. `/v1/` on guides.show is add-only (content-hashed, never overwritten or deleted) so exported files keep opening; the viewer is the same guide chain (`@plannotator/guide-viewer`) over `AllFilesCodeView` in `readOnly` mode — no drift by construction. Read-only hosts stub the annotation composer/popovers at build time (`apps/guides-show/build/read-only-stubs-plugin.ts`); do not add app-only surfaces to the guide chain without going through the `GuideHost` contract.

Viewer runtime invariants (`apps/guides-show/viewer/`): the highlight worker is fetched from guides.show and constructed locally, and HOW is decided by a live probe (`portablePool.tsx`: blob classic → blob module → data classic → data module; a one-line worker must answer), never by `location.protocol` — Chrome refuses blob *module* workers from `file://` asynchronously (its console says "cross-origin redirects of the top-level worker script") but accepts classic ones, and headless checks with `--allow-file-access-from-files` hide that, so test `file://` exports WITHOUT that flag. The worker bundle must stay import-free (`check-budgets` asserts it) so it can run as a classic worker. A pool that is not initialized within 4 s is dropped (`PoolWatchdog`) and the guide re-renders on the main thread; Pierre renders nothing while waiting on a pool whose workers died, so this is what keeps diffs from going blank. The exported document's plain-text fallback article is opacity 0 for the first 2.5 s (CSS-only reveal), so a cold viewer download shows the theme ground, then the guide skeleton, then the guide — never a flash of the fallback prose. The portable page must not set `overflow` on `body`/`html`: `GuideViewportManager.findScrollRoot` walks up for an `overflow-y: auto|scroll` ancestor to use as its IntersectionObserver root + scroll-event source, and an overflow on body propagates to the viewport without body itself scrolling — the manager would observe a never-scrolling element, mark everything "near", rank by distance from the middle of the whole document, and CodeViews would only mount on hover (`requestMount`). The manager now treats body/html as the window regardless, but keep the CSS clean too.

Three producers share the one pure export (`createGuideHtml`): the in-app **Download portable guide** button, `plannotator guide export --id <saved>`, and the agent path `plannotator guide export --guide guide.json --patch guide.patch` (`packages/server/guide/guide-cli.ts`, `buildAuthoredGuideSnapshot`) used by the standalone `plannotator-guide` agent skill (its own repo, `plannotator/guides` — deliberately NOT part of this repo or its installers). The authored form takes the same `{ title, intent, sections, unplacedFiles? }` shape the in-app generator emits plus optional `review { gitRef, base }`, `source`, `generator`; it is STRICT where the in-app validator is lenient (a file not in the patch, or placed twice, is an error listing the patch's files — exit 1 — rather than a silently dropped chapter), fills `source` from git in cwd (`origin` → owner/repo, branch, head sha) unless the guide supplies one, and round-trips the built snapshot through the strict format parser so a bad `source`/`generator` fails at export time. `--patch -` reads stdin. The skill's worked example is the `AUTHORED` fixture in `guide-cli.test.ts` — keep them in step.

### Hosted share links (guide share hosting)

Contract: `adr/implementation/guide-share-hosting.md` (names, routes, shapes and error codes there are final; change them there first). A guide can also be shared as a link on a guide host instead of a downloaded file: the review header's Share menu offers **Download portable guide** (unchanged) and **Create share link**; the CLI has `plannotator guide share --id <saved> | --guide g.json --patch p.patch | --snapshot s.json [--public] [--ttl 7d|24h|30m|3600] [--json]` (stdout: the URL, or `{ id, url, deleteToken, expiresAt? }` with `--json`; stderr: the size and the exact `Delete with: plannotator guide unshare <id> --token <t>` line) and `plannotator guide unshare <id> --token <t>` (removal goes to the host a saved guide's record names, else `PLANNOTATOR_GUIDE_SHARE_URL` / `guideShareUrl`). `--id` refuses with exit 1 while the saved guide already records a link. Exit codes match `export` (0 / 1 not found, invalid, service error / 2 usage). The upload itself is `shareGuide` / `unshareGuide` in `packages/server/guide/guide-share.ts` (vendored to Pi as `apps/pi-extension/generated/guide-share.ts`; both review servers expose the same `/share`, `/share-info` and `DELETE /share` endpoints). No upload ever happens without the Create click or the CLI command.

Two modes, encrypted by default. **Encrypted** stores `encrypt(await compress(snapshot))` (the same `@plannotator/core/crypto` + `@plannotator/core/compress` pair plan share links use); the key is generated by the uploader and lives ONLY in the URL fragment (`#key=<key>`, `GUIDE_SHARE_KEY_PARAM`), which browsers never send to the server, so the host holds ciphertext it cannot read and the page it serves is a shell that fetches `/api/g/<id>` and decrypts in the browser. **Plain** (`--public` / "Allow link previews", `{ public: true }`) stores the snapshot JSON (validated server-side with `parseGuideSnapshotJson`) so the hosted page can carry `<title>`, `og:*` and the guide text; use it when a chat app should unfurl the link. Both modes cap the stored body at `MAX_SHARED_GUIDE_BYTES` (25 MiB; `413`), have no expiry unless `ttlSeconds` (CLI `--ttl`) sets one, and return a one-time `deleteToken` (16 random bytes base64url, stored as a hex SHA-256) that is the only way to remove the guide besides the saved-envelope record.

Where it lives: `apps/guides-show/share/` (`core/handler.ts` is the pure request handler, `core/storage.ts` the `GuideStore` interface, `stores/{r2,memory}.ts`), served by the Cloudflare Worker (`apps/guides-show/worker/index.ts`, R2 bucket binding `GUIDES` = `guides-show-guides`). "Self-hostable" means deploying that Worker yourself and pointing `PLANNOTATOR_GUIDE_SHARE_URL` at it. Routes: `POST /api/g` (`201 { id, url, deleteToken, expiresAt? }`, `400`/`413`/`429`), `GET /g/<id>` (HTML, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, styled 404 page), `GET /api/g/<id>` (the stored body, CORS `*`), `DELETE /api/g/<id>` with `Authorization: Bearer <deleteToken>` (`204`/`401`/`404`), `OPTIONS /api/g*`. Upload guards: the size cap plus a per-IP rate limit on creation only (Cloudflare's `[[ratelimits]]` binding, 20 creates per minute per `CF-Connecting-IP`, `429` + `Retry-After`), optional in the Worker's `Env` and fail-open whenever it cannot resolve, so local runs and self-hosts without the binding are unlimited. Guides are kept indefinitely by decision (no host-imposed TTL, nothing prunes the bucket); only an upload's own `ttlSeconds` expires one, enforced on read.

Invariants: hosted pages of either mode carry `<meta name=GUIDE_HOSTED_META_NAME>` (plus `<link rel=canonical>`, `robots noindex`, `og:*`), which is how the viewer knows to add its client-side **Download** button (builds the portable file from the DOM-reconstructed viewer pin, never re-fetches, never includes the hosted meta); the encrypted shell (`createGuideShellHtml`) additionally carries `<meta name=GUIDE_PAYLOAD_META_NAME>` naming `/api/g/<id>` and NO title, intent or payload in the HTML; a plain page embeds the snapshot like an export and has no payload meta. The key must never appear anywhere but the fragment (not in a query string, not in a request, not in a stored record other than the uploader's own envelope). The uploader sends its viewer pin (`{ js, css, jsIntegrity, cssIntegrity, langs? }` from `GUIDE_VIEWER_MANIFEST`) and the host renders with it on its OWN `/v1/` (`baseUrl` is never sent); without a pin the host uses its bundled manifest. Error pages name the serving host, never guides.show, and store failures answer `500 { error: "internal error" }` with the real message logged host-side only. One link per guide in Plannotator (`409` on a second upload); removal goes to the host the record names. Deploying the Worker with the `guides-show-guides` bucket is a separate, explicit step: no production deploy without a bucket, and never as part of a build.

## Markdown Parser

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/parser.ts`

`parseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown)` splits markdown into Block objects. Handles:

- Headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) with slug-derived anchor ids
- Code blocks (``` with language extraction)
- List items (`-`, `*`, `1.`)
- Blockquotes (`>`) — including GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE|TIP|WARNING|CAUTION|IMPORTANT]`) which set `alertKind`
- Horizontal rules (`---`)
- Tables (pipe-delimited) — rendered via `TableBlock` with a `TableToolbar` (copy as markdown/CSV) and `TablePopout` overlay
- Raw HTML blocks (`<details>`, `<summary>`, etc.) — rendered via `HtmlBlock` through `marked` + DOMPurify
- Directive containers (`:::kind ... :::`) — rendered via `Callout`
- Paragraphs (default) with inline extras: bare URL autolinks, `@mentions` / `#issue-refs`, emoji shortcodes, smart punctuation

`exportAnnotations(blocks, annotations, globalAttachments)` generates human-readable feedback for Claude. Images are referenced by name: `[image-name] /tmp/path...`. Annotations with `diffContext` include `[In diff content]` labels.

## Annotation System

**Selection mode:** User selects text → toolbar appears → choose annotation type
**Redline mode:** User selects text → auto-creates DELETION annotation

Text highlighting uses `web-highlighter` library. Code blocks use manual `<mark>` wrapping (web-highlighter can't select inside `<pre>`).

**Annotation undo/redo:** each plan, annotate, or code-review app keeps one bounded 50-action stack for the active surface. `Mod+Z` undoes; `Mod+Shift+Z` and `Mod+Y` redo. Only local human annotation mutations are recorded, and a new mutation discards the redo branch. Native inputs, textareas, contenteditable regions, CodeMirror, dialogs/popovers, the Image Annotator, and an open Review Edit Mode session keep ownership of their own history shortcuts. External/agent writes do not enter annotation history; direct source changes, draft/share restore, refresh or diff replacement, identity changes, navigation to another document/message/review context, submission, and other baseline replacements clear it. The Image Annotator keeps a separate stroke undo/redo stack while its overlay is open.

**Cross-file annotations (multi-document annotate sessions).** A folder session — and any session whose linked documents carry feedback — spreads one body of feedback over many documents, so the annotations panel has a scope toggle in its header: **This file | All files**. It appears only when feedback exists outside the open document (`isMultiDocumentSession` in `packages/editor/App.tsx`); message multi-select keeps its own cross-message surface and is excluded. The toggle replaces the old `+N in M other files` flash affordance as the primary answer to "there are comments elsewhere"; the flash survives as a "Show in files" link at the foot of the All files view, and the header keeps a quiet `+N elsewhere` count while the scope is This file.

*Default rule* (`resolveInitialAnnotationScope`, `packages/ui/utils/annotationScope.ts`): the saved preference wins, except that a document with **no feedback of its own while other documents have some** opens on All files — that is the frustration the view exists for. It is re-resolved on every document change (keyed on the open document only, so a toggle is never yanked away mid-document), and the explicit choice persists per browser in the `plannotator-annotation-scope` cookie. One exception: arriving by clicking a card in the All files list keeps the All files scope, because that list is where the reviewer was.

*Grouping* is `groupAnnotationsByDocument` (pure, same file): one collapsible group per document that actually carries feedback, the open document first and the rest by path, labelled relative to the deepest session root the file browser knows. Cards are the same `AnnotationCard` the single-document timeline renders, so quote, comment, type, images, replies, Edit and Delete behave identically.

*Editing another document's comments* writes straight into that document's stored annotations through `useLinkedDoc`'s `updateStoredAnnotations` (the linked-doc cache, or the stashed source document); the active document is refused outright, since its annotations are host state. The export reads the same map, so a cross-file delete is reflected in what is submitted. **These cross-file mutations are deliberately not undoable:** the annotation history stack describes the open document's surface, and an entry that undid into a document the reviewer is not looking at would restore invisible state. `Mod+Z` still covers everything done in the open document.

*Jumping* (`useAnnotationJump`, `packages/editor/hooks/`) navigates through the file browser's own selection path — so the active file, the doc URL and the linked document stay in step — waits for the commit that makes the target the open document, then selects it, which is what scrolls markdown highlights and drives the HTML viewer's marker selection. A navigation that never commits drops the request rather than selecting an id into whatever document is open later. An HTML destination is opened with `revealSidebar: false`, exactly like a link click between HTML documents (#1532): that surface's page owns the viewport and the header carries its own Back, so arriving there must not pop the left sidebar. Both callers ask the same shared predicate, `documentRendersHtml` in `packages/ui/utils/htmlLinkNavigation.ts`.

*Counts:* the panel header shows the scoped count, but the session total the decision control runs on (`feedbackAnnotationCount`) is computed from session state and is unaffected by the toggle — switching scope never changes what is submitted. Not covered: code review, single-document plan review, and live-app multi-page sessions (which already group their export by page). The compact/touch sheet reuses `AnnotationPanel`, so it gets the same toggle in its own header bar. Every panel prop is optional and additive, so a host that passes none of them (Workspaces) renders the previous panel, legacy affordance included.

**Diagram comments (Mermaid and Graphviz fences).** A comment composed on a rendered diagram part — a click on a node, edge or cluster in the inline canvas or the popout — becomes an `Annotation` on the document with ONE additive field, `diagramAnchor` (`DiagramAnchor` from `@plannotator/core/diagram-anchor`, the `htmlAnchor` precedent): `{ v: 1, family, kind, id | from + to, label, sourceLine }` (families: flowchart, state, class, er, requirement, sequence, other, graphviz; kinds: node, edge, cluster, and `diagram` for the whole diagram, which has no id), where the anchor is the diagram's OWN id for the part (sequence parts carry classes, not ids, so the codec's ids are the actor's `name`, `msg-<n>`, `note-<n>`, `frame-<n>` by document order, restored with a label check because an ordinal moves) (never the rendered element id with its trailing counter, never geometry) and `sourceLine` names 1-based DOCUMENT lines (the offset is `Block.diagramSourceLineOffset ?? Block.startLine`: a fence's opening line sits one above the diagram's first line, so a fence uses its `startLine`, while a whole-file diagram source sets the offset to 0 because its first line IS document line 1). The annotation carries the fence's `blockId`, `startOffset`/`endOffset` 0, the label as `originalText`, `type: COMMENT` and the tater identity, so it lists in the annotations rail beside text comments, exports, persists in drafts (opaque JSON), and restores after a reload: `useAnnotationHighlighter` skips rows carrying `diagramAnchor` (neither attempted nor unanchored), and `DiagramBlock` re-resolves them against every render through the engine's finder — id, then label, then unanchored — and reports through `Viewer.onRestoreReport` with its own comments as `attempted`, so App's `markdownUnanchoredIds` shows the same "Unanchored" chip a text comment gets. All three export paths (`exportAnnotations`, `exportLinkedDocAnnotations`, `exportAnnotationEntry`) print the location line `Diagram node <label> (<id>), line <n>` (whole diagram: `Diagram (<family>), lines a–b`) under the comment's heading; a WebMCP reply inherits its parent's `diagramAnchor`; the diagram block is `annotation-exclude`, so text restore can never wrap a `<mark>` inside the svg. The line comes from (`diagramAnchorLocationLine`; edges name both ends); the feedback archive records the validated anchor as `diagramAnchor`; `POST /api/external-annotations` accepts a validated `diagramAnchor` on plan comments (both runtimes, `400` when malformed; such rows carry `blockId: "external"`, and like a comment whose fence was deleted they are resolved BY ANCHOR against every diagram block through `DiagramAnchorClaims` (`components/diagram/anchorClaims`, provided by `Viewer`): the first block in document order whose finder resolves it shows it, and when every block answered and none did it is reported unanchored); share links drop the anchor exactly like `htmlAnchor` (`sharing.multiTarget.test.ts`). Every renderer read of the field is nullish-safe (`ann.diagramAnchor != null`, `?.family`): a row reaches the renderer from several local ingests, and a malformed anchor must list as unanchored, never throw during render. Selecting a diagram comment in the rail pulses its ring, pans it into view and scrolls the block into view. Plannotator passes `maxAdditionalTargets` 0 (one part per comment; the viewer's shift-click multi-select is a host opt-in) and no `onSave` (no Source pane; the in-block Show-source toggle keeps the fence readable). Read-only documents (archive) open no composer.

**Diagram files (annotate `.mmd`/`.mermaid`/`.dot`/`.gv`).** `plannotator annotate flow.mmd` opens the FILE as one diagram in the same engine — `DiagramBlock` → `DiagramViewer` → `DiagramPopout`, themed, click-to-comment on nodes/edges/clusters/the whole diagram, drafts, export, per-file version history — rather than refusing it or rendering it as text. Three pieces, one decision each:

1. **Core** (`packages/core/annotatable.ts`): the four extensions join the annotatable plain-text and doc sets (they ARE UTF-8 text, so CLI resolution, the 2MB `MAX_ANNOTATABLE_FILE_BYTES` cap, folder discovery, the file browser and `/api/doc` need no special case), and `diagramRenderKindForPath` is the single predicate that names the engine. They are not markdown: `shouldStripFrontmatter` returns **false** for them, because Mermaid's own `--- … ---` config block is diagram content, and `normalizeMarkdownExtensions` can never re-register them.
2. **Servers** (`packages/server/annotate.ts` + `reference-handlers.ts`, mirrored in `apps/pi-extension/server/serverAnnotate.ts` + `reference.ts`): `/api/plan` and `/api/doc` set `renderAs` to `"mermaid"`/`"graphviz"` and keep the file's RAW text as the body. The session-level guard is the shared pure `annotateDiagramRenderKind`, so both runtimes exclude raw-HTML, converted, URL, folder, message and live-app sessions identically. Version history is unchanged (diagram text is text).
3. **Editor** (`packages/editor/App.tsx`): `renderAs` widens to `DocumentRenderAs` (`'markdown' | 'html' | DiagramRenderKind`) and the `blocks` memo becomes `diagramDocumentBlocks(text, kind)` (`packages/ui/utils/parser.ts`) — ONE `code` block whose language routes to the engine, so `Viewer`, `diagramAnchor` comments, `useAnnotationHighlighter` skipping, the export, drafts and restore are the fence path unchanged. The block sets `startLine: 1` + `sourceLineCount` (so the export's `(lines a–b)` label names the file's real span) and `diagramSourceLineOffset: 0` (so a comment's `sourceLine` is the file's own line — a synthesized ```` ```mermaid ```` wrapper would report every line one too high). Edit Mode and the Select/Markup input-method strip are excluded with HTML: the block is `annotation-exclude`, so there is no text to drag-select.

Share links carry the FENCED form in the payload's `p` (`shareableDocumentMarkdown`, `packages/ui/utils/sharing.ts`): the portal has no server to tell it `renderAs`, and fencing needs no portal change and no new payload flag. Diagram comments themselves still degrade to text comments in a share link, exactly as they do from a fence (`diagramAnchor` is dropped like `htmlAnchor`).

**Raw-HTML annotate:** the sandboxed viewer never mutates the visited page's DOM. Committed annotations render as numbered placed comment markers plus overlay-projected highlight rectangles inside a shadow-rooted fixed overlay host: the durable anchor data (element selector, text snapshot, normalized selected point) is persisted, and the markers/highlights are disposable projections re-resolved from it on every reconcile. Shift-click multi-select joins additional elements to one comment (`htmlAdditionalTargets`).

**Element context (agent-facing).** A pinpoint also captures a bounded description of the element at click time, `elementContext` on the annotation (`HtmlElementContext` in `packages/ui/types.ts`; extra targets carry a smaller one as `context`), built by `buildElementContext` in the bridge and re-validated at the parent trust boundary by `parseHtmlElementContext`, which lives in `packages/core/html-anchor.ts` beside `parseHtmlElementAnchor` (#1549); `useHtmlAnnotation.ts` imports and re-exports it rather than mirroring it, and the host persistence helpers in that same core module (`buildPersistedHtmlAnchor`, `projectHostThreads`) run it too, so a host that persists and projects through core keeps the field instead of dropping it on save. It is purely descriptive, never read by restore. Fields: tag, id, author classes, an ancestor `path`, explicit-or-implicit `role`, accessible `name`, an ALLOWLISTED attribute set (href/src scrubbed of query and fragment, `data:` truncated to its media type), rendered `text` (300), a collapsed HTML `outline` (600 chars; two child levels, then one, then a per-tag count, whichever first fits), child count, viewport `rect`, nearest `landmark` and `heading`, a `component` hint from `data-component`/`data-testid` ancestry (deliberately no React fiber reads), and in live-app sessions the `page` route and title. Never captured: form values, `on*` handlers, `style`, script/style/template contents, full innerHTML. Hard cap 2 KiB serialized per primary (1 KiB per extra target), shedding outline → text → attrs → classes → path → heading → landmark → component. Under the persisted anchor's own 16 KiB budget `buildPersistedHtmlAnchor` sheds contexts — per-target first, from the end, then the primary — BEFORE it drops any target, since a context is descriptive and re-derivable on the next click while a dropped target loses a marker the reviewer placed; `DEFAULT_HTML_ANCHOR_MAX_BYTES` is unchanged and the dropped-target counts still count targets only. The export (`elementContextExportBlock` in `packages/ui/utils/parser.ts`) prints a 4-backtick `html` fence of the outline plus `selector` / `path` / `role` · `name` · `component` / `attrs` / `text` / `box` / `near` lines under the comment; a text-less pinpoint's placeholder quote (`[element: Navigation]`) becomes `Feedback on the <nav> element — "Primary"` in the heading, while a pinpoint with real quoted text keeps its quote line and gains the block. Annotations without the field export byte-identically. The grouped live-app export omits the `route` line (the `## Page:` heading carries it); `exportAnnotationEntry` (one annotation, no number) includes it; it is a pure helper for hosts and tests, and the annotation panel's card chrome is unchanged. Both helpers also take `includeOutline` (default `true`): `false` prints the identity lines without the fenced outline, for model turns where the 600-char outline is the expensive part per annotation. Share links drop `elementContext` exactly like anchors. The feedback archive records identity only (`elementTag`, `elementSelector`, `elementPath`, `elementRole`, `elementName`, `pageUrl`), never the outline. No `BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump: the field is additive in both directions.

**HTML and live-app interaction model:** raw-HTML sessions and live app sessions (`mode: "annotate-app"`) share one contract. Both open with pinpoint **armed** (`htmlAnnotateArmed` defaults to `true`, `packages/editor/App.tsx:493`; live sessions open armed like every other HTML surface, `App.tsx:2871`). `Esc` walks a ladder instead of exiting outright: a pending draft closes first, then the pinpoint hover outline clears, and only then does `Esc` drop the surface to **Interact**, where the bridge goes passive so clicks, forms, text selection, and SPA navigation reach the page natively (`packages/ui/components/html-viewer/bridge-script.ts:3066-3080`; committed markers stay visible and a marker click still opens its comment, and in Interact an open drag-comment draft still closes before `Esc` is handed back to the page). Vim owns its own ladder and is skipped here. The header **pen** button toggles Annotate/Interact (`packages/editor/components/AppHeader.tsx:386-404`, `aria-pressed`), as does `Mod+Shift+A` (`packages/ui/shortcuts/plan-review/htmlAnnotate.shortcuts.ts`) — a real toggle in BOTH directions, which is what makes it the answer to "Esc dropped me to Interact, how do I get back?". Disarming through either path tears down any pending draft, because the bridge's `set-annotate-mode(false)` handler clears every pending affordance (`bridge-script.ts:719-739`), exactly as the Esc ladder does. The bridge mirrors the chord inside the iframe on the capture phase and forwards it to the parent, so it works whichever document owns focus. Text drag-selection commenting is **always live**, on both surfaces and in both states, ungated from the armed flag and from the input method (`bridge-script.ts:384-386`, `:1420-1436`): while armed, a click pins an element and a drag selects text at the same time, and the one-shot `dragEndedClick` guard stops a completed drag's trailing click from re-pinning (`bridge-script.ts:1381-1390`).

These surfaces are **comment-only**. `redline` (auto-DELETION) and `quickLabel` are clamped at the trust boundary, which is the parent's postMessage ingest rather than the server, covering the host mode and a page-supplied `modeOverride` alike so a hostile page cannot force a DELETION (`packages/ui/components/html-viewer/useHtmlAnnotation.ts:535-547`). Only CREATION is restricted: persisted DELETION annotations still restore and still render their deletion styling (`useHtmlAnnotation.ts:903`). The selection toolbar drops Delete behind a `commentOnly` seam and is passed no quick-label handler (`packages/ui/components/AnnotationToolbar.tsx:217-224`, `HtmlViewer.tsx:880-883`); markdown surfaces keep the full toolbar. HTML surfaces also pin the viewer input method to pinpoint (`App.tsx:5480`), so there is no floating input-method toolstrip on them at all (`toolstripVisible` is gated on `!isHtmlSurface`, `App.tsx:2788-2793`) and the `Shift+1`-`4` annotation-mode shortcuts cannot fire there. A header **eye** button immediately left of the pen toggles Show/Hide tools, as does `Mod+Shift+X` (same scope, same bridge forwarding as the pen chord — the binding is deliberately un-mnemonic because every mnemonic letter is a browser chord: H is Chrome Home / Firefox history, E/I/J/K/C devtools, B/O bookmarks, V paste-as-plain-text, T reopen tab): hiding REMOVES all floating chrome over the page from the DOM (the sidebar tongue tabs and the comment/attachments cluster) rather than merely hiding it (`AppHeader.tsx:364-385`, `App.tsx:5193`, `HtmlViewer.tsx:810`). These surfaces **open with the tools hidden** — `DEFAULT_HTML_CHROME_STATE.toolsHidden` is true and `App.tsx` seeds `htmlToolsHidden` true so nothing flashes before the restore effect — because an HTML document is authored to fill the viewport. A fresh persisted record still wins in both directions, so a reviewer who showed the tools keeps them — in a folder annotate session too, which restores and records the `toolsHidden` half while leaving the sidebar/panel halves alone, since its file browser owns the sidebar for the whole session (`mergeHtmlChromeState`). The toggle lives in the header (and in the compact Options menu), so hidden — default or restored — always has a way back, which is what makes both honoring the persisted `toolsHidden` cookie and defaulting to hidden safe (`packages/ui/utils/htmlChrome.ts`). Note the version-diff "Show changes" control lives in that floating cluster, so it is behind the eye on a fresh session. All three header controls (eye, pen, Refresh) describe themselves through the app's `Tooltip` rather than a native `title` (`packages/ui/components/HtmlSurfaceControls.tsx`): two lines, the control's description — still the host-overridable `labels` string — over its shortcut as keycaps from `formatShortcutBindingTokens`, so the chord is never a hardcoded "Cmd". Because `title` no longer supplies the accessible name, the pen carries an explicit `aria-label` (defaulting to its description), the eye keeps its sr-only text and the Refresh its `aria-label`; the shortcut is additionally attached as a persistent `aria-describedby` span, because this Base UI build tags the popup with no ARIA at all. Refresh has no chord and renders no keycap row; `shortcuts` on the component overrides the bindings per control, defaulting to the `html-annotate` scope so the tooltips cannot drift from what the app dispatches.

**HTML Refresh (#1232).** A local rendered-HTML session can re-read its file from disk without reloading the tab, for the loop where an agent edits the page while the reviewer keeps annotating. The header **Refresh** button (left of the eye, `data-html-refresh`, titled "Refresh HTML from disk") fetches the active document through `/api/doc`, hands the bytes to the app, and remounts the viewer under a bumped `reloadGeneration` key (`packages/editor/App.tsx`, viewer `key`). The engine is the published `useHtmlRefresh` (`packages/ui/hooks/useHtmlRefresh.ts`: superseded and cross-document fetches are dropped, one restore acknowledgement per generation) and Plannotator's binding over `fetchHtmlDocumentSnapshot` is `packages/editor/hooks/useHtmlRefresh.ts` (toasts for refreshed, missing, and unavailable). Committed annotations survive on their durable anchors: the remounted viewer re-resolves every element selector and text snapshot against the new page, and the ones it cannot re-anchor are reported once (`onUnanchoredChange` to `reportAnnotationRestore`), toasted, and marked with an **Unanchored** chip in the annotations panel (`htmlUnanchoredIds` in App, cleared when the document changes); their comments stay in the panel and still export. A refresh keeps the version diff: for the root document `/api/doc` carries `previousPlan`/`versionInfo`/`diffHtml` recomputed against the bytes just read (see the annotate `/api/plan` row), `applyRefreshedHtml` sets them and resets `isPlanDiffActive`, so the view returns to normal mode with "Show changes" still available; a tab reload converges on the same state because `/api/plan` serves the current bytes and recomputes the same diff. `/api/share-html` shares the current bytes too. Only local files refresh: `canRefresh` is false for `http(s)` paths and live-app sessions, and the control is absent on read-only (archive) documents. The compact touch shell renders no header controls (`HtmlSurfaceControls` returns null when `compact`), so its Options menu offers "Refresh from disk" beside the Show/Hide tools and Interact/Annotate actions (`compactDocumentActions` in App, disabled while a refresh is in flight); a host that passes `canRefresh` and `onRefresh` to `HtmlSurfaceControls` gets the Refresh button with or without the eye.

**Links between local HTML documents.** A srcdoc document has no URL of its own — its base URL is the PARENT page's, which is the Plannotator server — so an ordinary `<a href="02-detail.html">` used to resolve onto the server, hit the catch-all, and render the whole editor inside the annotated frame; an in-page `#section` link navigated for the same reason. The bridge therefore **never lets the srcdoc frame navigate itself**: a capture-phase click handler registered before the pinpoint handler (and never stopping propagation, so armed clicks still pin the link element) `preventDefault`s every link click, scrolls in-page `#fragment`s locally, and posts the RAW href to the parent as `link-click`. `javascript:` hrefs are left to the page. The parent is the trust boundary: `parseBridgeMessage` bounds the href (2048 chars, no control characters) and `resolveHtmlLinkIntent` (`packages/ui/utils/htmlLinkNavigation.ts`, pure) decides what it means — a relative or `../` path resolves against the CURRENT document's directory and opens as a **linked document** through `/api/doc` exactly like a relative markdown link, a root-relative path (and the same path spelled with the server's own origin, the shape an author writes as `http://localhost:<port>/01-entry-point.html`) resolves against the directory the session was opened from, another origin opens in a **new tab** (`noopener,noreferrer`, the frame never navigates), a local file outside the annotatable set (`.pdf`, `.zip`) raises a toast and is never fetched, and every other scheme (`data:`, `file:`, `mailto:`, `blob:`) is dropped. The query string is stripped and the fragment is kept: it rides to the new document as `HtmlViewer`'s `initialFragment` and is replayed once that document's bridge is ready (`scroll-to-fragment`). Folder sessions route the open through the file-browser selection handler so the active file, the sidebar and the linked doc stay in step. Annotations stay per document (the `useLinkedDoc` cache), and the Interact/Annotate state and the chrome rules keep applying. **Navigating between HTML documents never opens the sidebar**: the page owns the viewport on this surface (it opens with the tools hidden and the sidebar closed), so a link click leaves the sidebar exactly as the reviewer had it — closed stays closed, open stays on its tab. `useLinkedDoc.open` / `openLoaded` take `revealSidebar` for this (default `true`, so every markdown caller is unchanged), and App passes `false` only when the target renders as HTML — `resolveHtmlLinkIntent`'s `rendersHtml`, which is false for markdown targets and for `.html` under `--markdown`, so a markdown target keeps the markdown convention of opening the Contents tab. The way back is therefore a **Back control in the header** (`data-html-back`, leftmost of the HTML surface controls, before Refresh/eye/pen), rendered only while a linked HTML document is open and named after the document it returns to ("Back to index.html"; `useLinkedDoc` keeps one root snapshot rather than a stack, so Back from any depth lands on the session's root). It deliberately claims **no keyboard shortcut** — `Alt`+`Left` and the browser's own Back belong to the user — and the compact touch shell offers the same action in its Options menu. The sidebar's "Viewing / Back to …" header still works for anyone who opens the sidebar, and `TableOfContents` now renders it even when the document has no headings at all, the normal case for raw HTML. The chrome restore-on-entry effect does not re-run on html→html navigation (`shouldRestoreHtmlChrome` in `packages/ui/utils/htmlChrome.ts` is false whenever the previous surface was HTML), so following a link cannot slam the tools back to hidden or re-apply a remembered sidebar state mid-session. **Armed pinpoint clicks still annotate**: navigation is suppressed in both states, but only Interact follows the link (`Esc`, the header pen, or `Mod+Shift+A` gets there). Live app sessions (`mode: "annotate-app"`) are excluded outright — the interceptor lives inside the bridge's `!LIVE` guard — because they navigate the proxied app for real. Known limitation, pre-existing and unchanged for LINKED documents (`/api/doc` mints a token per HTML file's own directory and refuses `..`, so `sub/page.html` opened as a linked document loads assets below it but not ones it reaches with `../`); **embedded** documents are not affected, because they load from the embedding page's token root — see the next paragraph.

**Embedded local documents.** The same "a srcdoc has no URL of its own" fact broke `<iframe src="prototype.html">` far worse than it broke links: the embed resolved onto the server, the catch-all answered with the app, and every embed in a report rendered a second Plannotator (#1554 — five of them, cookie-less because a nested context inherits the parent's sandbox flags). Links could be fixed by intercepting clicks; embeds cannot, because the `src` is routinely assigned by SCRIPT at runtime (`<iframe data-src="…" loading="lazy">` plus a loader) and may carry a query string, so no serve-time attribute rewrite ever sees it. The fix changes **resolution** instead of markup: `rewriteHtmlAssetReferences` installs a `<base href="/api/html-assets/<token>/">` first in `<head>`, so every relative URL the document produces — `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, `<object data>`, `<frame>`, a runtime `el.src = …`, a `fetch('./data.json')`, a `new URL(x, document.baseURI)` — lands in the document's own directory whatever writes it and whenever. The base is root-relative because a srcdoc resolves its own `<base href>` against the parent's URL (this server), so the port need not be known; an author's own `<base href>` is re-anchored when relative and left untouched when absolute or root-relative (they pinned an origin deliberately). `/api/html-assets` now serves `.html`/`.htm` as real documents, so an embedded page's own relative assets and nested relative embeds resolve against ITS position under the token root — including `../` back up to the root, which is why the linked-document limitation above does not apply here. Query strings and fragments survive to the embedded document untouched (`mock-decisions.html?step=result` sees its own `location.search`); the route only ever reads `url.pathname`.

*Security.* Embedded pages are untrusted author HTML served from the Plannotator server's origin. Inside the annotate surface the primary document's `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe already protects them: sandboxing flags are inherited and intersected by every nested browsing context, so an embed runs at an opaque origin with no `allow-same-origin` and its `fetch('/api/plan')` fails as cross-origin (verified in the browser, before AND after this change — the pre-fix nested Plannotator was already origin-`null`, which is exactly why the owner saw "no cookies in it"). Defense in depth for the case with no parent sandbox — a reviewer pasting an asset URL into a top-level tab — is on the response: every HTML response from the asset route carries `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts` (`HTML_ASSET_DOCUMENT_CSP`, never `allow-same-origin`) plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and no cookies are involved. Nothing widens what is readable: the same per-directory token, the same `..` refusal, the same `isWithinDirectory` symlink check; HTML documents additionally honour the 2MB `MAX_ANNOTATABLE_FILE_BYTES` annotate cap rather than the 50MB asset cap. The decision is single-sourced in `resolveHtmlAssetRoute` (`packages/shared/html-assets.ts`, vendored to Pi) so the Bun route and the Pi mirror cannot drift.

*Never the app in a frame — but only for a path that could BE a file.* Under the assets prefix, a request whose `Sec-Fetch-Dest` is `iframe`/`frame`/`embed`/`object`, or any `.html` path however it was made, gets a small plain 404 document naming the missing file instead of a JSON blob; ordinary asset misses keep their JSON shape. The annotate **catch-all** applies the same 404 document, but only when BOTH conditions hold (`isFramedEmbeddedDocumentRequest` = `isFramedFetchDest` && `pathNamesEmbeddedDocument`, `packages/shared/html-assets.ts`, vendored to Pi and used by both runtimes): the destination is framed, AND the path is not `/` and either its last segment carries an extension (`/prototype-slash.html`) or it sits under a directory segment (`/assets/frame`). `/` and a bare single-segment word (`/settings`) are served the app as always, so a framed session URL and any future SPA route cannot 404. The rule keys on the **shape of the path, not `Sec-Fetch-Site`**: an annotated page is a sandboxed srcdoc with an opaque origin, so its nested-document requests are `cross-site` — the same value the VS Code webview wrapper produces, and `none` on both sides for a pasted URL — so site can never separate the two, while the path can, because the app only ever loads at `/` and a relative embed is anchored at `/api/html-assets/<token>/` by the `<base href>` (with its own 404); only a root-relative embed reaches the catch-all at all. Scoping it this way is the #1561 regression fix: the VS Code extension renders the session URL inside an `<iframe>` behind its cookie proxy (`apps/vscode-extension/src/panel-manager.ts`, `cookie-proxy.ts`, which forwards headers verbatim) and every subcommand launched from a VS Code terminal is routed there by `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER`, so the unscoped guard made an annotate session opened from the editor show "404 Not found" and its one auto-reload 404 again. A NON-framed request for a missing path is untouched and still gets the app, exactly as before #1561. Plan and review servers carry no such guard.

*Pinpoint on an embed.* The bridge is **never** injected into a nested frame, so an embed is one pinpointable element from the outer page's perspective. While pinpoint is armed, frames are `pointer-events: none` (`body[data-plannotator-frame-inert]`, set by `updatePinpointCursor` for srcdoc sessions only — live-app sessions are untouched, since their nested frames belong to the user's app), which is what lets the click reach the outer document at all; hit-testing would then pass through to the container behind, so `preferInertFrameAt` resolves a point inside a frame's own rect back to the frame. Interact (`Esc`, the header pen, `Mod+Shift+A`) restores native interaction inside the embed — which is also the only state a link inside an embed can be followed from, exactly like the rest of this surface. An embed carries no text, so it takes the pre-existing text-less fail-closed anchor rule: the comment and its element context (tag, ancestor path, the frame's `title` as the accessible name) are recorded and exported, but the placed marker does not restore across a reload unless the author gave the frame an `id` or a `data-testid`. Text-carrying pins on the page around it restore normally.

*Portable export and share links.* Embeds do not travel. `inlineHtmlLocalAssets` inlines assets as `data:` URLs but a sibling document is a second page with its own relative assets, so it is not inlined; instead a document that contains any frame gets `<base href="about:blank">`, which makes its embeds render **empty** rather than resolving onto the share portal's own catch-all and reproducing this bug there. Everything else about a share link is unchanged.

Known limitations: printing a raw-HTML annotate session prints highlight stripes from a best-effort absolute-coordinate layer and is degraded inside the iframe (pre-existing); element-only targets (SVG anchors, multi-select additional element targets) have no print representation. Annotation undo/redo listeners live in the parent document, so they are unavailable while focus is inside a raw-HTML or live-app iframe; the framed page keeps its own `Mod+Z`. Focus the editor chrome or annotation panel first. Forwarding this safely would require synchronizing parent history availability without stealing native or live-app undo; only the two reserved chords are currently forwarded: `Mod+Shift+A` (annotate toggle) and `Mod+Shift+X` (show/hide tools).

## WebMCP (browser-agent tools)

The design document lives outside the tree (it is not checked in); the user-facing reference is `apps/marketing/src/content/docs/reference/webmcp-tools.md`. Phase 1 makes plan review and every annotate surface a WebMCP **provider**: a browser-integrated agent (Chrome/Edge origin trial, `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing` or `--enable-features=WebMCPTesting` locally; agent-embedded browsers unflagged) calls in-page tools instead of scraping the DOM. Code review (phase 2) and consuming the annotated app's own tools (phase 3) are not built.

**Shape (mirrors the shortcut system).** Engine in `packages/ui/webmcp/`: `modelContext.ts` is the ONLY file that spells `document.modelContext`, `registerTool`, `getTools`, `executeTool`, `toolchange` and the annotation hints (local structural types, no `webmcp-types` dependency, no `declare global`); `toolset.ts` (tool specs, the `{ ok, data, nudges, error? }` envelope, `runTool`, a per-document registry with reconcile-by-name and one `AbortController` per tool, since unregistration is only by abort); `changes.ts` (per-annotation `seq`, tombstones, per-tab watermark with `since` override, `claimOwn` so the agent's own writes are never "new" to it); `nudges.ts` (the twelve codes: `annotations_new`, `annotations_removed`, `replies_new`, `composer_open`, `source_stale`, `document_edited`, `comment_only_surface`, `page_changed`, `other_document_active`, `pending_unsent`, `session_decided`, `truncated`; messages are static strings, document and comment text never enter a message); `useToolset.ts` (React hook; handlers read through refs so a re-render never touches `registerTool`); `policy.ts` (the `webmcp` seam on `configurePlannotatorUI`, `{ enabled, namePrefix }`, default enabled with prefix `plannotator.`). Catalog in `packages/editor/webmcp/`: `documentTools.ts` builds the tools over a narrow `DocumentToolAdapter` (never imports App), `documentText.ts` holds the pure outline / windowing / quote-resolution helpers, `useDocumentWebMcp.ts` builds the adapter over App state through one ref.

**What is exposed.** `read_document` (the whole situation in one zero-argument call: session, text windowed at 16k chars cut at a block boundary with `textRange.nextOffset`, outline with per-section counts, every annotation with quote, context, `isNew` and thread ids, `otherDocuments`, nudges; `readOnlyHint` + `untrustedContentHint`), `add_comments` (1..20 items; anchoring cascade `inReplyTo` inherits the parent anchor, then `quote` resolved by text search with `section` to disambiguate, `ambiguous` returns candidate contexts, then `section` alone anchors on the heading, else a document-level note; `requestId` idempotency), `update_comment`, `remove_comments` (`destructiveHint`, ignored by today's dictionary on purpose), `reveal`, `nudge_user` (one transient banner, 280 chars, not persisted, not exported, dismissible), and `list_documents` in folder sessions only. Write tools are absent on archive and after the human's decision. Every tool-created comment is stamped `author` and `source: "browser-agent"` and renders exactly like an external-annotation comment.

**Rules.** (1) Decisions are human: there is no tool that approves, denies, submits feedback, closes the session, stages files or marks viewed, and there is no confirmation seam; the catalog test pins the names. (2) Ownership: the agent may update or remove only comments the tracker `claimOwn`ed in THIS page load (`AnnotationChangeTracker.isOwn`), never merely comments whose `source` reads `browser-agent`: `POST /api/external-annotations` accepts any `source`, so a stamp alone would let another tool's findings become agent-editable. Consequence: after a reload, the agent's earlier comments (restored from the draft) are read-only to it, like the human's; it replies instead. A `requestId` replayed after the human removed the comment it created answers `conflict` and never re-creates it. (3) Zero footprint without WebMCP: `resolveModelContext` runs once per mount; when `document.modelContext` is absent nothing is built, registered, rendered, fetched, scheduled or written. The opt-out is deliberately NOT a settings-registry entry: `configStore.ensureLoaded` seeds every registry default into a cookie on first settings access, on every surface including the guides.show viewer, so the preference lives in `packages/ui/webmcp/preference.ts`, is read lazily, and writes `plannotator-webmcp-tools=false` only when the user opts out (turning the tools back on removes the cookie). The phase-1 PR's A/B proof compared DOM shell, requests, console, timer counts and the cookie jar between the main and branch builds in a browser without the API and found no difference, and the portable viewer bundle is byte-identical to main. (4) Indicator policy: nothing visible appears merely because the API exists; only after the first successful tool call does the header show the small "Agent" affordance (`data-webmcp-indicator`). (5) Iframes: Plannotator never registers tools inside the untrusted frames, the srcdoc viewer keeps `sandbox="allow-scripts"` with no `allow` attribute and the live-app iframe gets no `allow="tools"`, so a framed page cannot register or impersonate tools (`packages/ui/webmcp/iframeIsolation.test.ts` pins this at source level; in Chrome both frames answer `NotAllowedError` for `getTools` and `registerTool`). (6) Opt-out: Settings > General > "Agent tools" (row shown only when the API exists) aborts every registration when off. (7) No server changes: the Pi and OpenCode builds get the feature through the built HTML.

**Folder sessions.** `list_documents` walks the file browser's loaded directories (`fileBrowser.dirs`, absolute path = `${dir.path}/${node.path}`, vault dirs excluded) so every document is listed, not only the ones already visited. The agent learns that the human navigated from `document.path` on its next response, not from a sibling flag: siblings exclude the open path, and after a sidebar click `fileBrowser.activeFile` equals `linkedDoc.filepath`, so a sibling with `open: true` (and with it `openedSinceLastRead` and the "opened" branch of `other_document_active`) exists only transiently, during the load window between the click and the document commit. `reveal { path }` answers `not_found` at once for a path that is neither in the folder tree nor in the linked-doc cache; otherwise it navigates (folder sessions through App's file-browser selection handler, so the active file, the doc URL and the linked document stay in step) and WAITS for the commit that makes that path the open document (an effect settles the waiter, and the linked-doc `error` state settles it early when the load fails, so a bad path never runs out the 5s timeout) before looking the comment or section up; reading state right after the `await` would see the pre-navigation document. After a tool mutation the adapter overlays the pending write on the last committed annotation list (`applyOverlay`) so the response's nudges and the new comment's `seq` reflect the mutation even though `setAnnotations` has not committed yet; the agent's own removals are claimed (`claimRemoved`) so they are never reported back to it as `annotations_removed`. Still not reachable in phase 1: `composerOpen` for a sibling (the composer is detected from the DOM of the open document only, so `other_document_active` never fires for a composer in another document), and writes to a sibling that is not open (see below).

**`inReplyTo`.** One additive field on `Annotation`: a reply inherits its parent's anchor, renders indented under it in the annotations panel (`threadReplies` in `AnnotationPanel.tsx`), and exports nested under the parent's entry (`**Replies:**` block in `exportAnnotations`); an annotation without it renders and exports byte-identically to before. The threading rule is shared (`resolveReplyParents` in `packages/core/annotation-threads.ts`): an annotation is a reply only when its target is a different annotation in the same list and the parent chain never returns to it; orphans, self-references, and every member of a cycle render and export as roots in original order, so nothing is ever dropped and the export's header count equals what is emitted. `PATCH /api/external-annotations` refuses an `inReplyTo` that is self, missing, or would close a cycle (`validateReplyTarget`, both runtimes, `400`). Drafts carry it (annotations are opaque JSON to the draft transport); share links deliberately do not (a reply shares as a plain comment on the same quote, the existing text-restore contract, pinned by `sharing.inReplyTo.test.ts`). Known limitation: comments on a sibling document that is not open answer `not_available` with a hint to `reveal { path }` first, because the linked-doc cache is a copy.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Location:** `packages/ui/shortcuts/` (engine + scope data), `packages/editor/shortcuts.ts` and `packages/review-editor/shortcuts.ts` (per-app surfaces).

The shortcut system has three layers:

1. **Engine** (`packages/ui/shortcuts/{core,runtime}.ts`) — parser for declarative bindings (`Mod+Enter`, `Alt Alt` double-tap, `Alt hold`), dispatcher, platform-aware formatter (mac glyphs vs. `Ctrl`), validator, and the `useShortcutScope` / `useDoubleTapShortcuts` React hooks. Truly shared — both apps use it as-is.
2. **Scopes** — `defineShortcutScope({ id, title, shortcuts: { actionId: { bindings, description, section, ... } } })`. One scope per UI surface (annotation toolbar, comment popover, file tree, etc.). App-specific scopes live in `packages/ui/shortcuts/{plan-review,code-review}/` — **the subfolder names which app's UI the scope serves** — while genuinely cross-app scopes such as `history.shortcuts.ts` and `decisionControl.shortcuts.ts` (the header decision control's note-composer chords, mounted identically by both apps) live at the shortcuts root. Components/Apps wire handlers to a scope via `useShortcutScope({ scope, handlers: { actionId: () => ... } })`.
3. **Surfaces** (`packages/editor/shortcuts.ts`, `packages/review-editor/shortcuts.ts`) — each app composes its scopes into a `ShortcutSurface` (`planReviewSurface`, `annotateSurface`, `codeReviewSurface`). Surfaces feed both the in-app help modal and the marketing site's auto-generated docs page.

**Convention for adding new shortcuts:** define the action in the relevant app-specific subfolder (`plan-review/` or `code-review/`), or at the shortcuts root when both apps share the same action and semantics. Declare the binding(s) and description, then wire a handler at the call site with `useShortcutScope`. The marketing docs page picks it up automatically at next build. Unit tests in `packages/ui/shortcuts.test.ts` enforce normalized binding tokens (`Mod`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `A-Z`, `1-0`, named keys, `F1`–`F12`) and unique scope ids.

**Marketing docs auto-generation:** `apps/marketing/src/lib/shortcutReference.ts` reads the three surfaces and `apps/marketing/src/components/ShortcutReference.astro` renders them as tables. The `/docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts` page is special-cased in `apps/marketing/src/pages/docs/[...slug].astro` to render the component instead of the markdown body.

## URL Sharing

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/sharing.ts`, `packages/ui/hooks/useSharing.ts`

Shares full plan + annotations via URL hash using deflate compression. For large plans, short URLs are created via the paste service (user must explicitly confirm).

**Payload format:**

```typescript
// Image in shareable format: plain string (old) or [path, name] tuple (new)
type ShareableImage = string | [string, string];

interface SharePayload {
  p: string; // Plan markdown
  a: ShareableAnnotation[]; // Compact annotations
  g?: ShareableImage[]; // Global attachments
  d?: (string | null)[]; // diffContext per annotation, parallel to `a`
  s?: (string | undefined)[]; // source per annotation (external tool identifier), parallel to `a`
  h?: string; // Raw HTML content (direct HTML rendering mode)
  r?: 'html'; // Render mode flag (omitted = markdown)
}

type ShareableAnnotation =
  | ["D", string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?] // [type, original, author, images?]
  | ["C", string, string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?] // [type, original, comment, author, images?]
  | ["G", string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?]; // [type, comment, author, images?]
```

**Compression pipeline:**

1. `JSON.stringify(payload)`
2. `CompressionStream('deflate-raw')`
3. Base64 encode
4. URL-safe: replace `+/=` with `-_`

**On load from shared URL:**

1. Parse hash, decompress, restore annotations
2. Find text positions in rendered DOM via text search
3. Apply `<mark>` highlights
4. Clear hash from URL (prevents re-parse on refresh)

Known limitation: share links intentionally do not carry HTML element anchors or additional multi-select targets. Restore on the raw-HTML surface is text-search based; this is the contract asserted by `sharing.multiTarget.test.ts`.

## Settings Persistence

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/storage.ts`, `planSave.ts`, `agentSwitch.ts`

Uses cookies (not localStorage) because each hook invocation runs on a random port. Settings include identity, plan saving (enabled/custom path), and agent switching (OpenCode only).

## Syntax Highlighting

There is **one** highlighter in the app: the Shiki instance `@pierre/diffs` already runs for the code-review diff pane, driven by Shiki's **JavaScript regex engine** (`preferredHighlighter: 'shiki-js'`). `highlight.js` is gone. The wrapper is `packages/ui/utils/codeHighlight.ts`:

- `applyHighlight(el, code, lang, theme)` — imperative drop-in for the old `hljs.highlightElement(el)`. Writes plain text immediately (final size on first paint, no layout shift), then swaps in highlighted markup once the grammar is attached; already-attached grammars highlight synchronously, so there is no flicker on cached highlights. It also enforces that the rendered text is byte-identical to the source and falls back to plain text otherwise, because the annotation layer addresses code blocks by text offset.
- `highlightToHtml(code, lang, theme)` / `ensureHighlight(lang, theme)` — the sync/async pair behind it, for callers that need HTML strings (the code-file hover preview).
- `codeBlockClassName(lang)` — the `pn-code font-mono language-{lang}` class every fenced `<code>` carries. **`pn-code` replaced the old `hljs` class** and is the structural hook `blockTargeting`, vim navigation and `print.css` use (`pre > code.pn-code`); `language-*` is how `blockTargeting` reads a block's language back out of the DOM.
- `onCodeHighlightSwap(listener)` — observes every write `applyHighlight` makes, SYNCHRONOUSLY, immediately after it. Each write replaces the element's children, so it also destroys whatever the annotation layer wrapped inside the fence.

**Code-block annotation marks and highlight swaps.** `web-highlighter` cannot select inside a `<pre>`, so a fenced block is annotated all-or-nothing: one `<mark data-bind-id>` that is the `<code>` element's only child, painted by `paintCodeBlockMark` (`packages/ui/utils/codeBlockMark.ts`) — which MOVES the token spans into the mark rather than flattening them to text, so annotating or re-theming a block never costs it its colours. `Viewer` subscribes to `onCodeHighlightSwap` and re-paints that mark right after any swap, which is what keeps a palette or dark/light change from wiping code-block annotations. Being driven by the swap is also what makes the share/draft restore race safe **by ordering rather than by timing**: a restore that painted before the swap is re-established in the same task the swap ran in, and one that runs after finds the mark already there. Do not "fix" a mark-eating swap by skipping the rewrite when a mark is present — that leaves annotated blocks in stale theme colours.

**Language-less fences render as plain text and are never guessed at (#1212). There is no auto-detection anywhere.** `HighlightedCode` (review suggestions) derives its language from the caller's file path via `detectLanguage`; an unrecognised extension renders plain.

**Theming:** fences resolve the SAME theme the diff pane resolves, via `resolveFenceTheme` / `resolveSyntaxTheme` in `packages/ui/utils/syntaxTheme.ts` (keyed on `(colorTheme, resolvedMode)`; `packages/review-editor/hooks/usePierreTheme.ts` re-exports them). `useFenceTheme()` (`packages/ui/hooks/useFenceTheme.ts`) feeds the components and re-highlights on palette or mode change. Palettes with no Shiki counterpart fall back to `@pierre/diffs`' own `pierre-dark` / `pierre-light`. Consequence: code blocks follow the active palette in both light and dark instead of always rendering github-dark, so **do not add per-theme `.hljs-*`-style token CSS** — pick the right Shiki theme in `SHIKI_THEME_MAP` instead.

**Mermaid runtime (12.x, lazy):** `@plannotator/ui` pins `mermaid` exactly (12.0.0 since ui 0.40.0; Mermaid 12 lays flowchart/state/class/ER/requirement diagrams out with ELK by default and targets Safari 17.4+ / ES2024 — we take its defaults rather than pinning the 11.x ones). The runtime is loaded lazily on the first diagram through `packages/ui/utils/mermaid.ts`'s own `import('mermaid')`: `packages/editor/App.tsx` deliberately does NOT import `@plannotator/ui/utils/mermaid-eager` (it did through ui 0.39.0), so a plan with no diagram never downloads the ~2 MB runtime + ELK on the share portal or in a host build, and `tests/entry-assets.test.ts` fails if the eager import creeps back into either app. The single-file builds (`apps/hook`, `apps/review`, opencode, the compiled binary) still inline the runtime through `inlineDynamicImports`, so the lazy import saves nothing there and resolves from the bundle itself; the Mermaid 12 cost in those builds is the runtime's own growth. `MermaidBlock` shows the source fence under a "Rendering diagram" status until the first render lands (never the error panel as a placeholder), and `applyMermaidTheme` is keyed on the runtime object, so the lazily loaded runtime is themed on its first render exactly like an eagerly registered one. `mermaid-eager` stays exported for hosts that want the old startup registration.

**Diagram engine (ui 0.41.0):** every Mermaid and Graphviz diagram renders through ONE renderer slot and ONE canvas, the viewer moved in from Workspaces (owner ruling: the new engine, not an option). `MermaidBlock` and `GraphvizBlock` are thin wrappers over `packages/ui/components/DiagramBlock.tsx`, which keeps the fence side (`diagramLanguages.ts`, the pending fence under "Rendering diagram…", the error panel with the source, the per-engine Retry epoch, the Show-source toggle, the natural-height box) and renders `DiagramViewer` (`packages/ui/components/diagram/`) inline and again at full size in `DiagramPopout` (the `TablePopout` chrome; one code path). The renderer slot is `packages/ui/utils/diagram-render.ts`: `renderDiagram(kind, renderId, source, theme)` loads the engine through its runtime slot (`utils/mermaid.ts` as before, with `applyMermaidTheme` per (palette, mode) before every render; `utils/graphviz.ts`, new, the same shape, `@viz-js/viz` pinned exactly `3.30.0`), sanitizes the output into a NODE (`sanitizeDiagramSvg` = DOMPurify `parseDiagramSvg` + the in-place `scrubDiagramSvg` belt: no script, no `on*`, no `javascript:`/`data:` reference, no `<a href>` — a Mermaid click binding must never turn a pinpoint click into a navigation), and pairs it with the engine's finder (`utils/diagram-anchor.ts` for Mermaid's id grammar, `utils/diagram-anchor-graphviz.ts` keyed on `g.node > title`, never `nodeN`). A load failure is a value (`runtimeUnavailable: true`), which is the one failure Retry can change; one automatic re-attempt runs after the slot's retry delay. The canvas (`DiagramCanvas`) mounts the node with `replaceChildren` inside a CSS-transformed wrapper — wheel/drag/`+`/`-`/`0`/arrow keys; click-to-select vs drag-to-pan on a pointer-type-aware threshold (4 px mouse, 10 px finger); NO hover targeting on a plain mouse-over (owner ruling: it read as messy and fought the pan hand — the ring under the pointer appears only while the platform modifier is held, `isModKeyHeld`, and disarms on its release, on any other key, and on blur); canvas keys ignore Meta/Ctrl/Alt so browser chords pass through; inline the canvas is `touch-action: pan-y` (a finger scrolls the page past it) and only the popout is `touch-none`; the zoom strip is `data-print-hide` while rings and badges print. Every edge gets an invisible 14 px hit path in ONE layer appended last in the svg root (`widenEdgeHitAreas`: bare geometry, ancestors' transforms composed, no id/class/`data-*`, `diagramHitSource` maps it back) — measured in Chromium, the only thing painted over an edge is its OWN label box, centred on its midpoint, so a label is a target that resolves to its edge, and because the hit layer sits over the nodes the canvas resolves a click by PRIORITY over `elementsFromPoint` (node, then edge, then cluster), never by `event.target`. A click that resolves no part comments on the WHOLE diagram (kind `diagram`), so a click never does nothing. The scrub also scopes every `<style>` to rules under the svg's own root id (`scopeDiagramCss`: no `@import`, no fetching `url(`, no rule that could restyle the page). And the overlay (`DiagramOverlay`) reprojects rings and badges from `getBBox` through `getScreenCTM` each frame (`utils/diagram-projection.ts`), so they keep constant pixel size at every zoom. `components/mermaidSvg.ts` is gone. Under happy-dom DOMPurify is not functional (foreign-realm fragment, mislabelled svg namespaces, a cached `Node.prototype.nodeName` getter), so DOM tests swap the parse step for an inert XML parse through `__setDiagramSvgParserForTests` (`packages/ui/test-setup/diagramSvg.ts`) while the scrub still runs; the DOMPurify parse is proven in Chromium (the parity run in the PR that landed it). Real rendered svgs for the codec tests live in `packages/ui/test-setup/fixtures/diagrams/` with Chromium-measured geometry beside them.

**Diagram theming (Mermaid):** diagrams follow the palette and mode the same way fences do, through ONE dynamic mapping rather than per-palette themes. `packages/ui/utils/mermaidTheme.ts` reads the live CSS tokens off the document element (`readThemeTokens`: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, `--border`, `--muted`, `--muted-foreground`, `--primary`, the accent tokens, `--font-sans`), derives a complete Mermaid `themeVariables` set for every diagram family from them (`buildMermaidThemeVariables(tokens, mode)`, pure; base theme `dark` under a dark resolved mode, `default` under light; node fill from `card`, borders from `border`, edges and arrowheads from `muted-foreground`, text from `foreground`/`card-foreground`, clusters from `muted`, twelve categorical fills for pie/git/mindmap/journey seeded from `primary`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `destructive` and normalized to one lightness per page polarity), and `MermaidBlock` runs the global `mermaid.initialize` through `applyMermaidTheme` once per `(palette, mode, shadow amount)` key from `useTheme()` before each render, re-rendering mounted diagrams when the key changes. Every colour handed to Mermaid is opaque hex (its colour library does not read `oklch()`), and a contrast guard (`ensureContrast`) repairs any text-on-fill pair under WCAG 4.5:1 or line-on-canvas pair under 3:1 (plus 0.1 headroom) by the smallest OKLab step toward `foreground`, then `background`, then pure black/white — guarding page-level text and lines against every surface they can cross (the `bg-muted/30` canvas over the document card and over the bare page, `card`, `muted`, `popover`, ER rows), not the page background alone; `mermaidTheme.test.ts` sweeps every palette in `packages/ui/themes` in both modes against that rule, so a new palette cannot regress it. The pure toolkit behind it is `packages/ui/utils/cssColor.ts`. **Node shadow:** Mermaid 12's neo look shadows every node, cluster and actor from its own fixed `drop-shadow(1px 2px 2px rgba(185,185,185,1))` grey, which reads as a halo on a themed page. The look is kept and that one filter is replaced: `buildMermaidThemeVariables` sets `themeVariables.dropShadow` from `buildMermaidShadow(ground, amount)` at `DEFAULT_MERMAID_SHADOW_AMOUNT` (**0.7**, i.e. 70 on the user-facing 0-100 scale, where 100 reproduces Mermaid's own geometry exactly and 0 publishes `dropShadow: false` — plus `nodeShadow: false`, the only thing that reaches a state diagram's inline-filtered start/end dots — which the neo rules render as `filter: none`). The colour is derived from the palette's own ground and its POLARITY follows the page, the same way Mermaid's `insertLookDefs` picks a white flood colour on dark themes: on a dark page the ground lifted 82% toward white at alpha `0.18 + 0.72a`, on a light page darkened 40% toward black at `0.25 + 0.3a`, each asserted to differ from the ground in the direction that reads (white/black as the fallback, Mermaid's grey when the palette yields no usable ground). A black shadow on a near-black ground is a valid filter that paints nothing, which is why polarity — not just alpha — follows the page. The amount is the cookie-only `diagramShadow` setting (Settings → Display → "Diagram Shadow", steps 0/40/70/100, `packages/ui/utils/diagramShadow.ts`), which rides into the renderer as `DiagramTheme.shadowAmount` and into the cache key; at the default the key is byte-identical to the old `(palette, mode)` one. It is a paint-time filter only: fills and label colours are identical at every amount (pinned in `mermaidTheme.test.ts`). **Host fallback:** with no theme tokens on the document `readThemeTokens` returns `undefined` and the runtime keeps the static `MERMAID_CONFIG` (still `securityLevel: 'strict'`, pinned) with no extra `initialize`, so a host without `ThemeProvider`/`theme.css` renders exactly as before — that config carries the same 70 geometry with a fixed light shadow colour, since its own slate theme is dark. A host that wants Mermaid's grey back sets its own `themeVariables.dropShadow` after ours; one that wants no shadow passes `shadowAmount: 0`. Do not add per-palette Mermaid themes or per-theme `.mermaid` CSS — extend the token mapping instead. Graphviz has no theme system, so the renderer slot's `themeGraphvizSvg` recolors the DOT DEFAULTS onto the tokens after the scrub (the white page polygon removed, `fill="none"` → `var(--card)`, default black strokes → `var(--foreground)` on nodes and edges and `var(--border)` on clusters, `lightgrey` → `var(--muted)`, text → `var(--foreground)`) and leaves every author color alone; it needs no per-palette equivalent.

**Printing (light half, one rule):** paper is white, so the whole page prints in
the **LIGHT half of the user's pair** — prose, code and diagrams together.
`ThemeProvider` forces `preferredMode` to `light` while printing
(`packages/ui/hooks/usePrintMedia.ts`), which flows through the existing
`applyThemeClasses` and, because `applyMermaidTheme` is keyed on
`(palette, mode)`, re-renders every mounted diagram in the light palette;
Graphviz follows with no re-render at all, since `themeGraphvizSvg` paints
`var(--*)` tokens. Two signals drive it, because neither covers every path:
`beforeprint` / `afterprint` (a real Cmd+P and print preview — the class write
happens INSIDE the handler, since the print snapshot is taken before React
would flush a state update) and a `matchMedia('print')` change (headless
`page.emulateMedia({ media: 'print' })`, where the async diagram re-render also
lands). The stored preference is never written, and a light-mode user sees no
change. `usePrintMode` shares the subscription, so `.plannotator-print` is
applied under print emulation too.

`print.css` exempts diagram content from its typography rules with
`:not([data-diagram-block] *)` on the blanket `body, div, span, p, …` selector
and its `strong` / `em` / `p` siblings. A diagram colours itself and its own
`<style>` carries no `!important`, so the blanket rule beat it: Mermaid 12
draws node and edge labels as real HTML inside `<foreignObject>`
(`span.nodeLabel > p`, `span.edgeLabel`), which is how a dark-palette flowchart
used to print as empty boxes — near-black text on a near-black node fill. The
zoom strip stays `data-print-hide`; rings and badges still print.

**Bundle note:** Pierre imports Shiki's full bundle, so every grammar and theme is already inlined in the single-file builds; reusing its shared highlighter costs no extra bytes and needs no CDN or runtime wasm fetch. The Oniguruma WASM engine is dead weight under `shiki-js` and is aliased to `build/shiki-wasm-stub.ts` in the review, hook and portal Vite configs (via `resolve.alias`, which — unlike `plugins` — is shared with Vite's worker build).

## Requirements

- Bun runtime
- Claude Code with plugin/hooks support, or OpenCode
- Cross-platform: macOS (`open`), Linux (`xdg-open`), Windows (`start`)

## Development

```bash
bun install

# Run any app
bun run dev:hook       # Hook server (plan review)
bun run dev:review     # Review editor (code review)
bun run dev:portal     # Portal editor
bun run dev:marketing  # Marketing site
bun run dev:vscode     # VS Code extension (watch mode)
```

**Local `plannotator` command:** run `bun link` once in the checkout to make the global `plannotator` command use this repo's source (`apps/hook/server/index.ts`) instead of an installed release binary. Commands like `plannotator review` then reflect local changes immediately. Rebuild the bundled HTML when changing UI code (see Build below).

## Testing Rules

A test must guard a behavior that can actually regress. Before writing one, name the failure it catches; if you can't, don't write it.

- **Pin copy only on purpose, never as a snapshot.** Locking a short user-facing string is legitimate when it is a deliberate decision — an action label ("Approve"), a command name, a legally/UX-critical phrase the maintainer wants frozen so agents can't drift it. Mark it as such in a comment. What is banned is incidentally snapshotting explanatory prose (intro dialogs, setting descriptions, empty-state copy) with `toBe` just because it was on screen when the test was written — that couples wording edits to test churn while guarding nothing. If such a string carries data that must stay truthful (a server-computed size, a language list, a version), assert those facts with `toContain` on the data, not the sentence around them.
- **No round-trip prop tests.** Asserting that a hardcoded string passed as a prop appears in the DOM verifies nothing — any string round-trips. If the only thing worth checking is "this prop renders somewhere," use a sentinel string and one assertion, and say so in a comment.
- **Assert behavior, not implementation echo.** A test that restates what the code obviously does (calls X with Y, sets state to Z) without exercising an observable outcome is noise; it breaks on refactors and catches nothing.
- **Bun runs every test file in one process.** Never mutate `process.env`, `~/.plannotator`, or any global at module scope; mutate inside tests with restore in `finally`/`afterEach`, and sandbox all server/data-dir interaction under a temp `PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR`. Never read or write the real user config.

## Build

```bash
bun run build:hook       # Single-file HTML for hook server
bun run build:review     # Code review editor
bun run build:opencode   # OpenCode plugin (copies HTML from hook + review)
bun run build:portal     # Static build for share.plannotator.ai
bun run build:marketing  # Static build for plannotator.ai
bun run build:vscode     # VS Code extension bundle
bun run package:vscode   # Package .vsix for marketplace
bun run build            # Build hook + opencode (main targets)
```

**Important: Tailwind `@source` paths.** When creating new directories that contain `.tsx` files with Tailwind classes, add a matching `@source` entry to the app's `index.css`. Tailwind only generates CSS for classes it finds in scanned files — missing paths means classes appear in the DOM but have no effect.

**Important: Build order matters.** The hook build (`build:hook`) copies pre-built HTML from `apps/review/dist/`. If you change UI code in `packages/ui/`, `packages/editor/`, or `packages/review-editor/`, you **must** rebuild the review app first, then the hook:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/review build && bun run build:hook   # For review UI changes
bun run build:hook                                       # For plan UI changes only
bun run build:hook && bun run build:opencode             # For OpenCode plugin
```

Running only `build:hook` after review-editor changes will copy stale HTML files. When testing locally with a compiled binary, the full sequence is:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/review build && bun run build:hook && \
  bun build apps/hook/server/index.ts --compile --no-compile-autoload-bunfig \
  --define "__CLI_VERSION__=\"0.0.0-dev\"" --outfile ~/.local/bin/plannotator
```

These are the flags `.github/workflows/release.yml` compiles with; without the `__CLI_VERSION__` define `plannotator --version` falls back to `plannotator dev` and the binary cannot be told apart from any other local build. On macOS build with bun >= 1.3.14 (what CI pins): 1.3.12 loses the linker signature and the compiled binary is SIGKILLed on launch with no error (#541).

Running only `build:opencode` will copy stale HTML files.

## Marketing Site

`apps/marketing/` is the plannotator.ai website — landing page, documentation, and blog. Built with Astro 5 (static output, zero client JS except a theme toggle island). Docs are markdown files in `src/content/docs/`, blog posts in `src/content/blog/`, both using Astro content collections. Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Deploys to S3/CloudFront via GitHub Actions on push to main.

The `/docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts` page is auto-generated from the shortcut registry at build time — see the Keyboard Shortcuts section above. Editing the markdown body has no effect; update the scope files instead.
